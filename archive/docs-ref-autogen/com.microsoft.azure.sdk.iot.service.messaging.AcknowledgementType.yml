  summary: <p>This acknowledgement will requeue the received message back into the service's message queue so that it will be sent again. This may be done if the message in question should be received by a different receiver, or at a later time. Each service message has a finite number of times that it can be received and then abandoned before the message will be removed from the queue. This maximum number of times it can be received can be set through the Azure portal. </p>
