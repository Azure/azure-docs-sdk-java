  summary: "Build a publisher client with synchronous publishing methods and the current settings. Endpoint and a credential must be set (either keyCredential or sharedAccessSignatureCredential), all other settings have defaults and/or are optional. Note that currently the asynchronous client created by the method above is the recommended version for higher performance, as the synchronous client simply blocks on the same asynchronous calls."
