summary: "Annotation that can be used to either only include serialization of properties (during serialization), or only include processing of JSON properties read (during deserialization).\n\nExample:\n\n```java\n// to only include specified fields from being serialized or deserialized\n // (i.e. only include in JSON output; or being set even if they were included)\n @JsonIncludeProperties({ \"internalId\", \"secretKey\" })\n```\n\nAnnotation can be applied both to classes and to properties. If used for both, actual set will be union of all includes: that is, you can only add properties to include, not remove or override. So you can not remove properties to include using per-property annotation."
