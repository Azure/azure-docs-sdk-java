  summary: "Get the sortable property: A value indicating whether to enable the field to be referenced in $orderby expressions. By default Azure Cognitive Search sorts results by score, but in many experiences users will want to sort by fields in the documents. A simple field can be sortable only if it is single-valued (it has a single value in the scope of the parent document). Simple collection fields cannot be sortable, since they are multi-valued. Simple sub-fields of complex collections are also multi-valued, and therefore cannot be sortable. This is true whether it's an immediate parent field, or an ancestor field, that's the complex collection. Complex fields cannot be sortable and the sortable property must be null for such fields. The default for sortable is true for single-valued simple fields, false for multi-valued simple fields, and null for complex fields."
