  summary: "Method for checking if annotated property (represented by a field or getter/setter method) has definitions for views it is to be included in. If null is returned, no view definitions exist and property is always included (or always excluded as per default view inclusion configuration); otherwise it will only be included for views included in returned array. View matches are checked using class inheritance rules (sub-classes inherit inclusions of super-classes)\n\nSince 2.9 this method may also be called to find \"default view(s)\" for <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.introspect.AnnotatedClass\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"AnnotatedClass\"></xref>"
