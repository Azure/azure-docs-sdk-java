  summary: "Guides the allowed concurrency among update operations. Used as a hint for internal sizing. The table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates without contention. Because assignment of entries to these partitions is not necessarily uniform, the actual concurrency observed may vary. Ideally, you should choose a value to accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can lead to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one permits only one thread to modify the map at a time, but since read operations can proceed concurrently, this still yields higher concurrency than full synchronization. Defaults to 4.\n\n**Note:** Prior to Guava release 9.0, the default was 16. It is possible the default will change again in the future. If you care about this value, you should always choose it explicitly."
