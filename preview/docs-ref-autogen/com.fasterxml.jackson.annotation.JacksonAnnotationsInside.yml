summary: "Meta-annotation (annotations used on other annotations) used for indicating that instead of using target annotation (annotation annotated with this annotation), Jackson should use meta-annotations it has. This can be useful in creating \"combo-annotations\" by having a container annotation, which needs to be annotated with this annotation as well as all annotations it 'contains'."
