  summary: "Method that can be used to get access to object that is used as target for generated output; this is usually either <xref uid=\"java.io.OutputStream\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"OutputStream\"></xref> or <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"Writer\"></xref>, depending on what generator was constructed with. Note that returned value may be null in some cases; including case where implementation does not want to exposed raw source to caller. In cases where output has been decorated, object returned here is the decorated version; this allows some level of interaction between users of generator and decorator object.\n\nIn general use of this accessor should be considered as \"last effort\", i.e. only used if no other mechanism is applicable."
