  summary: "Introspection method that higher-level functionality may call to see whether underlying data format can read and write binary data natively; that is, embeded it as-is without using encodings such as Base64.\n\nDefault implementation returns `false` as JSON does not support native access: all binary content must use Base64 encoding. Most binary formats (like Smile and Avro) support native binary content."
