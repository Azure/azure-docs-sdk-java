  summary: "Reads up to `len` bytes of data from the session buffer into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as `len` bytes, but a smaller number may be read, possibly zero. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.\n\nThis method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n\nIf `off` is negative, or `len` is negative, or `off+len` is greater than the length of the array `b`, then an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown."
