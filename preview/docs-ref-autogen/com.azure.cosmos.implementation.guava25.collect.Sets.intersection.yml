  summary: "Returns an unmodifiable **view** of the intersection of two sets. The returned set contains all elements that are contained by both backing sets. The iteration order of the returned set matches that of `set1`.\n\nResults are undefined if `set1` and `set2` are sets based on different equivalence relations (as `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, and the keySet of an `IdentityHashMap` all are).\n\n**Note:** The returned view performs slightly better when `set1` is the smaller of the two sets. If you have reason to believe one of your sets will generally be smaller than the other, pass it first. Unfortunately, since this method sets the generic type of the returned set based on the type of the first set passed, this could in rare cases force you to make a cast, for example:\n\n```java\nSet aFewBadObjects = ...\n Set manyBadStrings = ...\n\n // impossible for a non-String to be in the intersection\n SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n Set badStrings = (Set) Sets.intersection(\n     aFewBadObjects, manyBadStrings);\n \n\n This is unfortunate, but should come up only very rarely.\n```"
