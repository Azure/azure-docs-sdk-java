  summary: "Gets the lock token for the current message.\n\nThe lock token is a reference to the lock that is being held by the broker in <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.models.ReceiveMode.PEEK_LOCK\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ReceiveMode#PEEK_LOCK\"></xref> mode. Locks are used to explicitly settle messages as explained in the [product documentation in more detail][]. The token can also be used to pin the lock permanently through the [Deferral API][] and, with that, take the message out of the regular delivery state flow. This property is read-only.\n\n\n[product documentation in more detail]: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement\n[Deferral API]: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-deferral"
