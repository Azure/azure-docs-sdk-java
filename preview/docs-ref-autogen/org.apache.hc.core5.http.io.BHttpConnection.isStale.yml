  summary: "Checks whether this connection has gone down. Network connections may get closed during some time of inactivity for several reasons. The next time a read is attempted on such a connection it will throw an IOException. This method tries to alleviate this inconvenience by trying to find out if a connection is still usable. Implementations may do that by attempting a read with a very small timeout. Thus this method may block for a small amount of time before returning a result. It is therefore an *expensive* operation."
