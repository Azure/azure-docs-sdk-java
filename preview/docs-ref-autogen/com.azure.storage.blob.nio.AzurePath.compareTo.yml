  summary: "Compares two abstract paths lexicographically. This method does not access the file system and neither file is required to exist.\n\nThis method may not be used to compare paths that are associated with different file system providers.\n\nThis result of this method is identical to a string comparison on the underlying path strings."

  returns:
    description: "zero if the argument is equal to this path, a value less than zero if this path is lexicographically less\n than the argument, or a value greater than zero if this path is lexicographically greater than the argument"
