summary: "Marker annotation that indicates that the logical property that the accessor (field, getter/setter method or Creator parameter \\[of <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonCreator\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonCreator\"></xref>\\-annotated constructor or factory method\\]) is to be ignored by introspection-based serialization and deserialization functionality.\n\nAnnotation only needs to be added to one of the accessors (often getter method, but may be setter, field or creator parameter), if the complete removal of the property is desired. However: if only particular accessor is to be ignored (for example, when ignoring one of potentially conflicting setter methods), this can be done by annotating other not-to-be-ignored accessors with <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonProperty\"></xref> (or its equivalents). This is considered so-called \"split property\" case and allows definitions of \"read-only\" (read from input into POJO) and \"write-only\" (write in output but ignore on output)\nNOTE! As Jackson 2.6, there is a new and improved way to define \\`read-only\\` and \\`write-only\\` properties, using <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty.access()\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonProperty#access()\"></xref> annotation: this is recommended over use of separate `JsonIgnore` and <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonProperty\"></xref> annotations.\n\nFor example, a \"getter\" method that would otherwise denote a property (like, say, \"getValue\" to suggest property \"value\") to serialize, would be ignored and no such property would be output unless another annotation defines alternative method to use.\n\nWhen ignoring the whole property, the default behavior if encountering such property in input is to ignore it without exception; but if there is a <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonAnySetter\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonAnySetter\"></xref> it will be called instead. Either way, no exception will be thrown.\n\nAnnotation is usually used just a like a marker annotation, that is, without explicitly defining 'value' argument (which defaults to `true`): but argument can be explicitly defined. This can be done to override an existing \\`JsonIgnore\\` by explicitly defining one with 'false' argument: either in a sub-class, or by using \"mix-in annotations\"."
