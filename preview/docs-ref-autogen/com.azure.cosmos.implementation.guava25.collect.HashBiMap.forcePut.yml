  summary: "An alternate form of `put` that silently removes any existing entry with the value `value` before proceeding with the <xref uid=\"com.azure.cosmos.implementation.guava25.collect.HashBiMap.put\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">#put</xref> operation. If the bimap previously contained the provided key-value mapping, this method has no effect.\n\nNote that a successful call to this method could cause the size of the bimap to increase by one, stay the same, or even decrease by one.\n\n**Warning:** If an existing entry with this value is removed, the key for that entry is discarded and not returned."
