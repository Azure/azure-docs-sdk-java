summary: "Marker interface used to denote JSON Tree nodes, as far as the core package knows them (which is very little): mostly needed to allow <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.ObjectCodec\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ObjectCodec\"></xref> to have some level of interoperability. Most functionality is within `JsonNode` base class in `mapper` package.\n\nNote that in Jackson 1.x `JsonNode` itself was part of core package: Jackson 2.x refactored this since conceptually Tree Model is part of mapper package, and so part visible to `core` package should be minimized.\n\nNOTE: starting with Jackson 2.2, there is more functionality available via this class, and the intent is that this should form actual base for multiple alternative tree representations; for example, immutable trees could use different implementation than mutable trees. It should also be possible to move actual Tree Model implementation out of databind package eventually (Jackson 3?)."
