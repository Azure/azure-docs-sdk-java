  summary: "Method called to check whether Object value at current output location should be included in output. Three kinds of return values may be used as follows:\n\n *  `null` to indicate that the Object should be skipped\n *  <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.filter.TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#INCLUDE_ALL\"></xref> to indicate that the Object should be included completely in output\n *  Any other <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.filter.TokenFilter\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"TokenFilter\"></xref> implementation (possibly this one) to mean that further inclusion calls on return filter object need to be made on contained properties, as necessary. <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.filter.TokenFilter.filterFinishObject()\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#filterFinishObject()\"></xref> will also be called on returned filter object\n\nDefault implementation returns `this`, which means that checks are made recursively for properties of the Object to determine possible inclusion."
