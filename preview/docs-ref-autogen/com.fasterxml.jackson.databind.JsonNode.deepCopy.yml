  summary: "Method that can be called to get a node that is guaranteed not to allow changing of this node through mutators on this node or any of its children. This means it can either make a copy of this node (and all mutable children and grand children nodes), or node itself if it is immutable.\n\nNote: return type is guaranteed to have same type as the node method is called on; which is why method is declared with local generic type."
  syntax: "public abstract T <T>deepCopy()"
  returns:
    description: "Node that is either a copy of this node (and all non-leaf\n    children); or, for immutable leaf nodes, node itself."
