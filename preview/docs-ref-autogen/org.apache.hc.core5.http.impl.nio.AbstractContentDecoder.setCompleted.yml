  summary: "Sets the completed status of this decoder to true. Normally this is not necessary (the decoder will automatically complete when the underlying channel returns EOF). It is useful to mark the decoder as completed if you have some other means to know all the necessary data has been read and want to reuse the underlying connection for more messages."
