  summary: "Receives an **infinite** stream of <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"messages\"></xref> from the Service Bus entity. This Flux continuously receives messages from a Service Bus entity until either:\n\n *  The receiver is closed.\n *  The subscription to the Flux is disposed.\n *  A terminal signal from a downstream subscriber is propagated upstream (ie. <xref uid=\"reactor.core.publisher.Flux.take*\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"Flux#take(long)\"></xref> or <xref uid=\"reactor.core.publisher.Flux.take*\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"Flux#take(Duration)\"></xref>).\n *  An <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"AmqpException\"></xref> occurs that causes the receive link to stop."
