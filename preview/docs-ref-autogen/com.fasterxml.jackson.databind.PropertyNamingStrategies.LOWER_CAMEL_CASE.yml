  summary: "Naming convention used in Java, where words other than first are capitalized and no separator is used between words. Since this is the native Java naming convention, naming strategy will not do any transformation between names in data (JSON) and POJOS.\n\nExample external property names would be \"numberValue\", \"namingStrategy\", \"theDefiniteProof\"."
