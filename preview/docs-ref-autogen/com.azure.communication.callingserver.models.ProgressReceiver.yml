summary: "A `ProgressReceiver` is an object that can be used to report progress on network transfers. When specified on transfer operations, the `reportProgress` method will be called periodically with the total number of bytes transferred. The user may configure this method to report progress in whatever format desired. Note that any method accepting a <xref uid=\"com.azure.communication.callingserver.models.ParallelDownloadOptions\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ParallelDownloadOptions\"></xref> will use the `ProgressReceiver` specified there and will handle the logic to coordinate the reporting between parallel operations."
