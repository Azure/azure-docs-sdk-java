  summary: "Method called to indicate that the underlying buffers should now be recycled if they haven't yet been recycled. Although caller can still use this text buffer, it is not advisable to call this method if that is likely, since next time a buffer is needed, buffers need to reallocated.\n\nNote: since Jackson 2.11, calling this method will NOT clear already aggregated contents (that is, `_currentSegment`, to retain current token text if (but only if!) already aggregated."
