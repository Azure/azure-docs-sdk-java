  summary: "Get the activationSignalOffset property: Signal offset once the gate is activated (can be negative). It determines the how much farther behind of after the signal will be let through based on the activation time. A negative offset indicates that data prior the activation time must be included on the signal that is let through, once the gate is activated. When used upstream of a file or video sink, this allows for scenarios such as recording buffered media prior an event, such as: record video 5 seconds prior motions is detected."
