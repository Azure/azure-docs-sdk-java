  summary: "Accessor method for testing what is the highest unescaped character configured for this generator. This may be either positive value (when escaping configuration has been set and is in effect), or 0 to indicate that no additional escaping is in effect. Some generators may not support additional escaping: for example, generators for binary formats that do not use escaping should simply return 0."
  syntax: "public int getHighestEscapedChar()"
  returns:
    description: "Currently active limitation for highest non-escaped character,\n   if defined; or 0 to indicate no additional escaping is performed."
