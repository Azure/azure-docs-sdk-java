summary: "HttpCore NIO is based on the Reactor pattern as described by Doug Lea. The purpose of I/O reactors is to react to I/O events and to dispatch event notifications to individual I/O sessions. The main idea of I/O reactor pattern is to break away from the one thread per connection model imposed by the classic blocking I/O model.\n\nThe IOReactor interface represents an abstract object implementing the Reactor pattern.\n\nI/O reactors usually employ a small number of dispatch threads (often as few as one) to dispatch I/O event notifications to a much greater number (often as many as several thousands) of I/O sessions or connections. It is generally recommended to have one dispatch thread per CPU core."
