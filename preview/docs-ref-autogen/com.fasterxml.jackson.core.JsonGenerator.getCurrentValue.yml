  summary: "Helper method, usually equivalent to: `getOutputContext().getCurrentValue();`\n\nNote that \"current value\" is NOT populated (or used) by Streaming parser or generators; it is only used by higher-level data-binding functionality. The reason it is included here is that it can be stored and accessed hierarchically, and gets passed through data-binding."
