  nameWithType: "AzurePath.resolveSibling(Path path)"
  summary: "Resolves the given path against this path's parent path. This is useful where a file name needs to be replaced with another file name. For example, suppose that the name separator is \"/\" and a path represents \"dir1/dir2/foo\", then invoking this method with the Path \"bar\" will result in the Path \"dir1/dir2/bar\". If this path does not have a parent path, or other is absolute, then this method returns other. If other is an empty path then this method returns this path's parent, or where this path doesn't have a parent, the empty path."
