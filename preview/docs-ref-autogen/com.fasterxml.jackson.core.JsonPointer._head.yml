  summary: "Reference from currently matching segment (if any) to node before leaf. Lazily constructed if/as needed.\n\nNOTE: we'll use \\`volatile\\` here assuming that this is unlikely to become a performance bottleneck. If it becomes one we can probably just drop it and things still should work (despite warnings as per JMM regarding visibility (and lack thereof) of unguarded changes)."
