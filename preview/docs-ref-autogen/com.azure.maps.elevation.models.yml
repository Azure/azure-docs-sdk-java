desc: "Package containing classes for ElevationClient. The Azure Maps Elevation API provides an HTTP interface to query\n elevation data on the surface of the Earth. Elevation data can be retrieved at specific locations by sending lat/lon\n coordinates, by defining an ordered set of vertices that form a Polyline and a number of sample points along the\n length of a Polyline, or by defining a bounding box that consists of equally spaced vertices as rows and columns. The\n vertical datum is EPSG:3855. This datum uses the EGM2008 geoid model applied to the WGS84 ellipsoid as its zero\n height reference surface. The vertical unit is measured in meters, the spatial resolution of the elevation data is\n 0.8 arc-second for global coverage (~24 meters)."
