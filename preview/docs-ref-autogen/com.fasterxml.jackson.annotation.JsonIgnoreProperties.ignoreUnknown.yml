  summary: "Property that defines whether it is ok to just ignore any unrecognized properties during deserialization. If true, all properties that are unrecognized -- that is, there are no setters or creators that accept them -- are ignored without warnings (although handlers for unknown properties, if any, will still be called) without exception.\n\nDoes not have any effect on serialization."

    description: "True if any and all unknown properties are to be ignored without\n   exceptions (or other special handling); false otherwise."
