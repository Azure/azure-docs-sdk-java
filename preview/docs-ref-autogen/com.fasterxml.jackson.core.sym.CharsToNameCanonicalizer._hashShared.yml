  summary: "Flag that indicates whether underlying data structures for the main hash area are shared or not. If they are, then they need to be handled in copy-on-write way, i.e. if they need to be modified, a copy needs to be made first; at this point it will not be shared any more, and can be modified.\n\nThis flag needs to be checked both when adding new main entries, and when adding new collision list queues (i.e. creating a new collision list head entry)"
