  summary: "Accessor for getting a pointer instance that is identical to this instance except that the last segment has been dropped. For example, for JSON Pointer \"/root/branch/leaf\", this method would return pointer \"/root/branch\" (compared to <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer.tail()\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#tail()\"></xref> that would return \"/branch/leaf\").\n\nNote that whereas <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer.tail*\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#tail\"></xref> is a very cheap operation to call (as \"tail\" already exists for single-linked forward direction), this method has to fully construct a new instance by traversing the chain of segments."
  syntax: "public JsonPointer head()"
  returns:
    description: "Pointer expression that contains same segments as this one, except for\n    the last segment."
