  summary: "If the size of the data is less than or equal to this value, it will be uploaded in a single put rather than broken up into chunks. If the data is uploaded in a single shot, the block size will be ignored. Some constraints to consider are that more requests cost more, but several small or mid-sized requests may sometimes perform better. In the case of buffered upload, up to this amount of data may be buffered before any data is sent. Must be greater than 0. May be null to accept default behavior, which is the maximum value the service accepts for uploading in a single requests, which varies depending on the service."
