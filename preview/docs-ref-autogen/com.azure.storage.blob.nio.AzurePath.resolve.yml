  summary: "Resolve the given path against this path.\n\nIf the other parameter is an absolute path then this method trivially returns other. If other is an empty path then this method trivially returns this path. Otherwise this method considers this path to be a directory and resolves the given path against this path. In the simplest case, the given path does not have a root component, in which case this method joins the given path to this path and returns a resulting path that ends with the given path. Where the given path has a root component then resolution is highly implementation dependent and therefore unspecified."
