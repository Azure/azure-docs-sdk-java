  summary: "Returns the backing delegate instance that methods are forwarded to. Abstract subclasses generally override this method with an abstract method that has a more specific return type, such as <xref uid=\"com.azure.cosmos.implementation.guava25.collect.ForwardingSet.delegate\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">ForwardingSet#delegate</xref>. Concrete subclasses override this method to supply the instance being decorated."
  syntax: "protected abstract Object delegate()"
