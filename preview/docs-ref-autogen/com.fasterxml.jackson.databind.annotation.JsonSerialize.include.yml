  summary: "Which properties of annotated Bean are to be included in serialization (has no effect on other types like enums, primitives or collections). Choices are \"all\", \"properties that have value other than null\" and \"properties that have non-default value\" (i.e. default value being property setting for a Bean constructed with default no-arg constructor, often null).\n\nThis property has been replaced by special-purpose <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude\"></xref> annotation, introduced in Jackson 2.0.\n\nNote that Jackson 2.3 changed default to `DEFAULT_INCLUSION`, which is roughly same as saying \"whatever\". This is important because it allows hierarchic default values to be used."
