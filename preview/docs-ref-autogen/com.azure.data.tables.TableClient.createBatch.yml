  summary: "Creates a new <xref uid=\"com.azure.data.tables.TableBatch\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"TableBatch\"></xref> object. Batch objects allow you to enqueue multiple create, update, upsert, and/or delete operations on entities that share the same partition key. When the batch is executed, all of the operations will be performed as part of a single transaction. As a result, either all operations in the batch will succeed, or if a failure occurs, all operations in the batch will be rolled back. Each operation in a batch must operate on a distinct row key. Attempting to add multiple operations to a batch that share the same row key will cause an exception to be thrown."

  - description: "The partition key shared by all operations in the batch."
