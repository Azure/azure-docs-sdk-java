summary: "Marker annotation that indicates that all properties that have type annotated with this annotation are to be ignored during serialization and deserialization.\n\nNote that this does NOT mean that properties included by annotated type are ignored. Given hypothetical types:\n\n```java\n@JsonIgnoreType\n  class Credentials {\n     public String password;\n  }\n\n  class Settings {\n     public int userId;\n     public String name;\n     public Credentials pwd;\n  }\n```\n\nserialization of `Settings` would only include properties \"userId\" and \"name\" but NOT \"pwd\", since it is of type annotated with `@JsonIgnoreType`.\n\nNote: annotation does have boolean 'value' property (which defaults to 'true'), so that it is actually possible to override value using mix-in annotations. Usually value is not specified as it defaults to `true` meaning annotation should take effect."
