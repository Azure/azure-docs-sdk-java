  summary: "Gets the owner level that indicates a publishing is intended to be performed exclusively for events in the requested partition in the context of the associated producer group. To do so, publishing will attempt to assert ownership over the partition; in the case where more than one publisher in the producer group attempts to assert ownership for the same partition, the one having a larger owner level value will \"win\". When an owner level is specified, other exclusive publishers which have a lower owner level within the context of the same producer group will either not be allowed to be created or, if they already exist, will encounter an exception during the next attempted operation. Should there be multiple producers in the producer group with the same owner level, each of them will be able to publish to the partition. Producers with no owner level or which belong to a different producer group are permitted to publish to the associated partition without restriction or awareness of other exclusive producers. The owner level is only recognized and relevant when certain features of the producer are enabled. For example, it is used by idempotent publishing. An <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">com.azure.core.amqp.exception.AmqpException</xref> will occur if an <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.EventHubProducerAsyncClient\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">EventHubProducerAsyncClient</xref> or <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.EventHubProducerClient\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">EventHubProducerClient</xref> is unable to publish events to the Event Hub partition for the given producer group id. In this case, the errorCondition of <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">com.azure.core.amqp.exception.AmqpException</xref> will be set to <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">com.azure.core.amqp.exception.AmqpErrorCondition#PRODUCER_EPOCH_STOLEN</xref>."
