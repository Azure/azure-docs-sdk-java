  summary: "Changes the change feed mode so that the change feed will contain events for creations, deletes as well as all intermediary snapshots for updates. Enabling full fidelity change feed mode requires configuring a retention duration in the change feed policy of the container. <xref uid=\"com.azure.cosmos.models.ChangeFeedPolicy\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ChangeFeedPolicy\"></xref>\n\nIntermediary snapshots of changes as well as deleted documents would be available for processing for 8 minutes before they vanish. When enabling full fidelity mode you will only be able to process change feed events within the retention window configured in the change feed policy of the container. If you attempt to process a change feed after more than the retention window an error (Status Code 400) will be returned because the events for intermediary updates and deletes have vanished. It would still be possible to process changes using Incremental mode even when configuring a full fidelity change feed policy with retention window on the container and when using Incremental mode it doesn't matter whether your are out of the retention window or not - but no events for deletes or intermediary updates would be included. When events are not getting processed within the retention window it is also possible to continue processing future events in full fidelity mode by querying the change feed with a new CosmosChangeFeedRequestOptions instance."
