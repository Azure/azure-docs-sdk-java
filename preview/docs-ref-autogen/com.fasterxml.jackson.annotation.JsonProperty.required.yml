  summary: "Property that indicates whether a value (which may be explicit null) is expected for property during deserialization or not. If expected, `BeanDeserialized` should indicate this as a validity problem (usually by throwing an exception, but this may be sent via problem handlers that can try to rectify the problem, for example, by supplying a default value).\n\nNote that as of 2.6, this property is only used for Creator Properties, to ensure existence of property value in JSON: for other properties (ones injected using a setter or mutable field), no validation is performed. Support for those cases may be added in future. State of this property is exposed via introspection, and its value is typically used by Schema generators, such as one for JSON Schema."
