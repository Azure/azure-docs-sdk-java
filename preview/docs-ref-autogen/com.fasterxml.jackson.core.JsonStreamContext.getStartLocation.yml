  summary: "Optional method that may be used to access starting location of this context: for example, in case of JSON \\`Object\\` context, offset at which \\`\\[\\` token was read or written. Often used for error reporting purposes. Implementations that do not keep track of such location are expected to return <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonLocation.NA\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonLocation#NA\"></xref>; this is what the default implementation does."

  syntax: "public JsonLocation getStartLocation(Object srcRef)"
  returns:
    description: "Location pointing to the point where the context\n   start marker was found (or written); never `null`.\n<p>\n NOTE: demoted from <code>JsonReadContext</code> in 2.9, to allow use for\n \"non-standard\" read contexts."
