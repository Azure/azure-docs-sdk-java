  summary: "Method for creating a new <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ObjectMapper\"></xref> instance that has same initial configuration as this instance. Note that this also requires making a copy of the underlying <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonFactory\"></xref> instance.\n\nMethod is typically used when multiple, differently configured mappers are needed. Although configuration is shared, cached serializers and deserializers are NOT shared, which means that the new instance may be re-configured before use; meaning that it behaves the same way as if an instance was constructed from scratch."
