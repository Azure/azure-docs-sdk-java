If the Type member is CRED\\_TYPE\\_DOMAIN\\_PASSWORD, this member contains the plaintext Unicode password for UserName. The CredentialBlob and CredentialBlobSize members do not include a trailing zero character. Also, for CRED\\_TYPE\\_DOMAIN\\_PASSWORD, this member can only be read by the authentication packages. If the Type member is CRED\\_TYPE\\_DOMAIN\\_CERTIFICATE, this member contains the clear test Unicode PIN for UserName. The CredentialBlob and CredentialBlobSize members do not include a trailing zero character. Also, this member can only be read by the authentication packages. If the Type member is CRED\\_TYPE\\_GENERIC, this member is defined by the application. Credentials are expected to be portable. Applications should ensure that the data in CredentialBlob is portable. The application defines the byte-endian and alignment of the data in CredentialBlob."
