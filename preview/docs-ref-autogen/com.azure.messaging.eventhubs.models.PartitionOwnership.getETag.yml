  summary: "Gets the ETag that was generated by the last known successful update to the partition ownership record. An ETag is a unique identifier \\* that is generated when a data record is successfully created/updated. The ETag is used to achieve optimistic concurrency in a distributed event processor setup. When multiple instances of event processor try to update the same partition ownership record, ETag is used to verify that the last values read by the instance requesting the update is still the latest ETag for this record. If the ETag in the store does not match the ETag in the update request, then the update is expected to fail as there was an update since the last time an event processor read this record."
