  summary: "Get the timestamp property: The time when the snapshot was created. The snapshot timestamp provides an approximation as to when a modification to a resource was detected. There can be a difference between the actual modification time and the detection time. This is due to differences in how operations that modify a resource are processed, versus how operation that record resource snapshots are processed."
