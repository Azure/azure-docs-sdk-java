summary: "Interface that those Jackson components that are explicitly versioned will implement. Intention is to allow both plug-in components (custom extensions) and applications and frameworks that use Jackson to detect exact version of Jackson in use. This may be useful for example for ensuring that proper Jackson version is deployed (beyond mechanisms that deployment system may have), as well as for possible workarounds."
