  summary: "Method called to close this generator, so that no more content can be written.\n\nWhether the underlying target (stream, writer) gets closed depends on whether this generator either manages the target (i.e. is the only one with access to the target -- case if caller passes a reference to the resource such as File, but not stream); or has feature <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"Feature#AUTO_CLOSE_TARGET\"></xref> enabled. If either of above is true, the target is also closed. Otherwise (not managing, feature not enabled), target is not closed."
