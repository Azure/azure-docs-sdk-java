  summary: "A set of \"field renamings\" that have been discovered, indicating intended renaming of other accesors: key is the implicit original name and value intended name to use instead.\n\nNote that these renamings are applied earlier than \"regular\" (explicit) renamings and affect implicit name: their effect may be changed by further renaming based on explicit indicators. The main use case is to effectively relink accessors based on fields discovered, and used to sort of correct otherwise missing linkage between fields and other accessors."
