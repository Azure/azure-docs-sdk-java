summary: "Marker annotation that can be used to define a non-static, no-argument value-returning (non-void) method to be used as a \"getter\" for a logical property. It can be used as an alternative to more general <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonProperty\"></xref> annotation (which is the recommended choice in general case).\n\nGetter means that when serializing Object instance of class that has this method (possibly inherited from a super class), a call is made through the method, and return value will be serialized as value of the property."
