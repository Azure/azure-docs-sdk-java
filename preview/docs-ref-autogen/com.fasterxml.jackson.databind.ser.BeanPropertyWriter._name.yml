  summary: "Logical name of the property; will be used as the field name under which value for the property is written.\n\nNOTE: do NOT change name of this field; it is accessed by Afterburner module (until 2.4; not directly from 2.5) ALSO NOTE: ... and while it really ought to be \\`SerializableString\\`, changing that is also binary-incompatible change. So nope."
