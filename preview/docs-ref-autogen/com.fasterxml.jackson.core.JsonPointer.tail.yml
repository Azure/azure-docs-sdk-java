  summary: "Accessor for getting a \"sub-pointer\" (or sub-path), instance where current segment has been removed and pointer includes rest of the segments. For example, for JSON Pointer \"/root/branch/leaf\", this method would return pointer \"/branch/leaf\". For matching state (last segment), will return `null`.\n\nNote that this is a very cheap method to call as it simply returns \"next\" segment (which has been constructed when pointer instance was constructed)."
  syntax: "public JsonPointer tail()"
  returns:
    description: "Tail of this pointer, if it has any; <code>null</code> if this pointer only\n    has the current segment"
