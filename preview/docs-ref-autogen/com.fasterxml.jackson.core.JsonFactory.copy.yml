  summary: "Method for constructing a new <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonFactory\"></xref> that has the same settings as this instance, but is otherwise independent (i.e. nothing is actually shared, symbol tables are separate). Note that <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.ObjectCodec\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ObjectCodec\"></xref> reference is not copied but is set to null; caller typically needs to set it after calling this method. Reason for this is that the codec is used for callbacks, and assumption is that there is strict 1-to-1 mapping between codec, factory. Caller has to, then, explicitly set codec after making the copy."
