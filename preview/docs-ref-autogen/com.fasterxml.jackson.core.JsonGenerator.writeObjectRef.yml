  summary: "Method that can be called to output references to native Object Ids. Note that it may only be called after ensuring this is legal (with <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator.canWriteObjectId()\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#canWriteObjectId()\"></xref>), as not all data formats have native type id support; and some may only allow them in certain positions or locations. If output is not allowed by the data format in this position, a <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerationException\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonGenerationException\"></xref> will be thrown."
