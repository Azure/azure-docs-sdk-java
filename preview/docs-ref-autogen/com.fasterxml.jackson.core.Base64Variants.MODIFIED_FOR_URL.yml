  summary: "This non-standard variant is usually used when encoded data needs to be passed via URLs (such as part of GET request). It differs from the base <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.Base64Variants.MIME\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#MIME\"></xref> variant in multiple ways. First, no padding is used: this also means that it generally can not be written in multiple separate but adjacent chunks (which would not be the usual use case in any case). Also, no linefeeds are used (max line length set to infinite). And finally, two characters (plus and slash) that would need quoting in URLs are replaced with more optimal alternatives (hyphen and underscore, respectively)."
