  summary: "Method that can be called to get a type instance that indicates that values of the type should be handled using \"static typing\" for purposes of serialization (as opposed to \"dynamic\" aka runtime typing): meaning that no runtime information is needed for determining serializers to use. The main use case is to allow forcing of specific root value serialization type, and specifically in resolving serializers for contained types (element types for arrays, Collections and Maps)."
