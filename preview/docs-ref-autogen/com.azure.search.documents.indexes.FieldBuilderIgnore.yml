summary: "Marker annotation that indicates the field or method is to be ignored by converting to SearchField. The annotation is useful in situations where a property definition doesn't cleanly map to a <xref uid=\"com.azure.search.documents.indexes.models.SearchField\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"SearchField\"></xref> object, but its values still need to be converted to and from JSON. In that case, ignore annotation in json serializer library can't be used since it would disable JSON conversion. An example of a scenario where this is useful is when mapping between a string field in Azure Cognitive Search and an enum property."
