  summary: "Overridable factory method that actually instantiates generator for given <xref uid=\"java.io.Writer\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"Writer\"></xref> and context object.\n\nThis method is specifically designed to remain compatible between minor versions so that sub-classes can count on it being called as expected. That is, it is part of official interface from sub-class perspective, although not a public method available to users of factory implementations."
