  summary: "Factory method called to create a new instance to use for deserialization: needed since resolvers may have state (a pool of objects).\n\nNote that actual type of 'context' is `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext`, but can not be declared here as type itself (as well as call to this object) comes from databind package."

  - description: "Deserialization context object used (of type\n            <code>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext</code>\n            ; may be needed by more complex resolvers to access contextual\n            information such as configuration."
