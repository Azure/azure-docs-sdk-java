summary: "Annotation used to indicate that a property should be serialized \"unwrapped\"; that is, if it would be serialized as JSON Object, its properties are instead included as properties of its containing Object. For example, consider case of POJO like:\n\n```java\npublic class Parent {\n    public int age;\n    public Name name;\n  }\n  public class Name {\n    public String first, last;\n  }\n```\n\nwhich would normally be serialized as follows (assuming @JsonUnwrapped had no effect):\n\n```java\n{\n    \"age\" : 18,\n    \"name\" : {\n      \"first\" : \"Joey\",\n      \"last\" : \"Sixpack\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\ncan be changed to this:\n\n```java\n{\n    \"age\" : 18,\n    \"first\" : \"Joey\",\n    \"last\" : \"Sixpack\"\n  }\n```\n\nby changing Parent class to:\n\n```java\npublic class Parent {\n    public int age;\n    @JsonUnwrapped\n    public Name name;\n  }\n```\n\nAnnotation can only be added to properties, and not classes, as it is contextual.\n\nAlso note that annotation only applies if\n\n *  Value is serialized as JSON Object (can not unwrap JSON arrays using this mechanism)\n *  Serialization is done using `BeanSerializer`, not a custom serializer\n *  No type information is added; if type information needs to be added, structure can not be altered regardless of inclusion strategy; so annotation is basically ignored."
