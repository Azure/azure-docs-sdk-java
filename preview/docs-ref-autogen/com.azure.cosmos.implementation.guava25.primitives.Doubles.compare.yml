  summary: "Compares the two specified `double` values. The sign of the value returned is the same as that of `((Double) a).(b)`. As with that method, `NaN` is treated as greater than all other values, and `0.0 > -0.0`.\n\n**Note:** this method simply delegates to the JDK method <xref uid=\"java.lang.Double.compare\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"Double#compare\"></xref>. It is provided for consistency with the other primitive types, whose compare methods were not added to the JDK until JDK 7."

  returns:
    description: "a negative value if <code>a</code> is less than <code>b</code>; a positive value if <code>a</code> is\n     greater than <code>b</code>; or zero if they are equal"
