  summary: "Returns the set of all possible subsets of `set`. For example, `powerSet(ImmutableSet.of(1, 2))` returns the set `{{}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}`.\n\nElements appear in these subsets in the same iteration order as they appeared in the input set. The order in which these subsets appear in the outer set is undefined. Note that the power set of the empty set is not the empty set, but a one-element set containing the empty set.\n\nThe returned set and its constituent sets use `equals` to decide whether two elements are identical, even if the input set uses a different concept of equivalence.\n\n*Performance notes:* while the power set of a set with size `n` is of size `2^n`, its memory usage is only `O(n)`. When the power set is constructed, the input set is merely copied. Only as the power set is iterated are the individual subsets created, and these subsets themselves occupy only a small constant amount of memory."
