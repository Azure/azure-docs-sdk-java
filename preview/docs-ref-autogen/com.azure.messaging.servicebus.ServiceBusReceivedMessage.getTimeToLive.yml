  summary: "Gets the duration before this message expires.\n\nThis value is the relative duration after which the message expires, starting from the datetime the message has been accepted and stored by the broker, as captured in <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage.getScheduledEnqueueTime()\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#getScheduledEnqueueTime()\"></xref>. When not set explicitly, the assumed value is the DefaultTimeToLive set for the respective queue or topic. A message-level TimeToLive value cannot be longer than the entity's DefaultTimeToLive setting and it is silently adjusted if it does."
