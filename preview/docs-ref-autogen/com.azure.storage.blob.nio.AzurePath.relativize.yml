  summary: "Constructs a relative path between this path and a given path.\n\nRelativization is the inverse of resolution. This method attempts to construct a relative path that when resolved against this path, yields a path that locates the same file as the given path.\n\nA relative path cannot be constructed if only one of the paths have a root component. If both paths have a root component, it is still possible to relativize one against the other. If this path and the given path are equal then an empty path is returned.\n\nFor any two normalized paths p and q, where q does not have a root component, `p.relativize(p.resolve(q)).equals(q)`"
