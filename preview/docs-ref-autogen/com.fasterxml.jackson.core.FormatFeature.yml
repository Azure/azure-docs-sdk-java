summary: "Marker interface that is to be implemented by data format - specific features. Interface used since Java Enums can not extend classes or other Enums, but they can implement interfaces; and as such we may be able to use limited amount of generic functionality.\n\nNote that this type is only implemented by non-JSON formats: types <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser.Feature\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonParser.Feature\"></xref> and <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator.Feature\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonGenerator.Feature\"></xref> do NOT implement it. This is to make it easier to avoid ambiguity with method calls."
