summary: "Marker interface that is to be implemented by data format - specific features. Interface used since Java Enums can not extend classes or other Enums, but they can implement interfaces; and as such we may be able to use limited amount of generic functionality.\n\nSince 2.12 this is more of an extra marker feature, as its core API is now defined in more general <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.util.JacksonFeature\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JacksonFeature\"></xref>."
