  summary: "Marker value that should be used to indicate inclusion of a structured value (sub-tree representing Object or Array), or value of a named property (regardless of type). Note that if this instance is returned, it will used as a marker, and no actual callbacks need to be made. For this reason, it is more efficient to return this instance if the whole sub-tree is to be included, instead of implementing similar filter functionality explicitly."
