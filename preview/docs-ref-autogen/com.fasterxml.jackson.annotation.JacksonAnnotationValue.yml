summary: "Marker interface used by value classes like <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFormat.Value\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonFormat.Value\"></xref> that are used to contain information from one of Jackson annotations, and can be directly instantiated from those annotations, as well as programmatically constructed and possibly merged. The reason for such marker is to allow generic handling of some of the annotations, as well as to allow easier injection of configuration from sources other than annotations."
