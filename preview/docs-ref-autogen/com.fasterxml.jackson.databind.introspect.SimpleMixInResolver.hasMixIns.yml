  summary: "Method that may be called for optimization purposes, to see if calls to mix-in resolver may be avoided. Return value of `true` means that it is possible that a mix-in class will be found; `false` that no mix-in will ever be found. In latter case caller can avoid calls altogether.\n\nNote that the reason for \"empty\" resolvers is to use \"null object\" for simplifying code."
  syntax: "public boolean hasMixIns()"
  returns:
    description: "True, if this resolver MAY have mix-ins to apply; false if not (it\n   is \"empty\")"
