  summary: "Returns the duration of time which this connection can be safely kept idle. If the connection is left idle for longer than this period of time, it MUST not reused. A value of 0 or less may be returned to indicate that there is no suitable suggestion. When coupled with a <xref uid=\"org.apache.hc.core5.http.ConnectionReuseStrategy\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"org.apache.hc.core5.http.ConnectionReuseStrategy\"></xref>, if <xref uid=\"org.apache.hc.core5.http.ConnectionReuseStrategy#keepAlive(\n org.apache.hc.core5.http.HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpContext)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"org.apache.hc.core5.http.ConnectionReuseStrategy#keepAlive(\n org.apache.hc.core5.http.HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpContext)\"></xref> returns true, this allows you to control how long the reuse will last. If keepAlive returns false, this should have no meaningful impact"
