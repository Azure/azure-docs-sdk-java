  summary: "Slightly non-standard modification of <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.Base64Variants.MIME\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#MIME\"></xref> which does not use linefeeds (max line length set to infinite). Useful when linefeeds wouldn't work well (possibly in attributes), or for minor space savings (save 1 linefeed per 76 data chars, ie. ~1.4% savings)."
