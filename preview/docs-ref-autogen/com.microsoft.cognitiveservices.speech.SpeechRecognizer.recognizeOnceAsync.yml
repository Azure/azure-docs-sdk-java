  summary: "Starts speech recognition, and returns after a single utterance is recognized. The end of a single utterance is determined by listening for silence at the end or until a maximum of 15 seconds of audio is processed. The task returns the recognition text as result. Note: Since recognizeOnceAsync() returns only a single utterance, it is suitable only for single shot recognition like command or query. For long-running multi-utterance recognition, use startContinuousRecognitionAsync() instead."
