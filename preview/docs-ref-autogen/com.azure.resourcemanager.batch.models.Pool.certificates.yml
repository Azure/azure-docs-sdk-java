  summary: "Gets the certificates property: For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ\\_BATCH\\_CERTIFICATES\\_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/\\{user-name\\}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory."
