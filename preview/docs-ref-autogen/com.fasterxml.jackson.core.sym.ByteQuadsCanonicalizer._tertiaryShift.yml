  summary: "Constant that determines size of buckets for tertiary entries: `1 << _tertiaryShift` is the size, and shift value is also used for translating from primary offset into tertiary bucket (shift right by `4 + _tertiaryShift`).\n\nDefault value is 2, for buckets of 4 slots; grows bigger with bigger table sizes."
