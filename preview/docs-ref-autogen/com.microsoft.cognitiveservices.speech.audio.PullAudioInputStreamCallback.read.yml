  summary: "Reads data from audio input stream into the data buffer. The maximal number of bytes to be read is determined by the size of dataBuffer. If there is no data immediately available, read() blocks until the next data becomes available. Note: The dataBuffer returned by read() should not contain any audio header."
  parameters:
  - description: "The byte array to store the read data."
    name: "dataBuffer"
    type: "<xref href=\"byte?alt=byte&text=byte\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"False\" />[]"
  syntax: "public abstract int read(byte[] dataBuffer)"
  returns:
    description: "The number of bytes filled, or 0 in case the stream hits its end and there is no more data available."
