  summary: "Reads a complete line of characters up to a line delimiter from this session buffer into the given line buffer. The number of chars actually read is returned as an integer. The line delimiter itself is discarded. If no char is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value `-1` is returned. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.\n\nThe choice of a char encoding and line delimiter sequence is up to the specific implementations of this interface."
