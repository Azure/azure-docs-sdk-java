  summary: "Method that may be called to check if this context is either:\n\n *  Object, with at least one entry written (partially or completely)\n *  Array, with at least one entry written (partially or completely)\n\nand if so, return \\`true\\`; otherwise return \\`false\\`. Latter case includes Root context (always), and Object/Array contexts before any entries/elements have been read or written.\n\nMethod is mostly used to determine whether this context should be used for constructing <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonPointer\"></xref>"
