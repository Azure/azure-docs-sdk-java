summary: "Annotation used for indicating that values of annotated type or property should be serializing so that instances either contain additional object identifier (in addition actual object properties), or as a reference that consists of an object id that refers to a full serialization. In practice this is done by serializing the first instance as full object and object identity, and other references to the object as reference values.\n\nThere are two main approaches to generating object identifier: either using a generator (either one of standard ones, or a custom generator), or using a value of a property. The latter case is indicated by using a placeholder generator marker <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator\"></xref>; former by using explicit generator. Object id has to be serialized as a property in case of POJOs; object identity is currently NOT support for JSON Array types (Java arrays or Lists) or Java Map types.\n\nFinally, note that generator type of <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.ObjectIdGenerators.None\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ObjectIdGenerators.None\"></xref> indicates that no Object Id should be included or used: it is included to allow suppressing Object Ids using mix-in annotations."
