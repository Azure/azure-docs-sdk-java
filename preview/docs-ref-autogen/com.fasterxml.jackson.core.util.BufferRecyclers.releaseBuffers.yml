  summary: "Specialized method that will release all recycled <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.util.BufferRecycler\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"BufferRecycler\"></xref> if (and only if) recycler tracking has been enabled (see <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.util.BufferRecyclers.SYSTEM_PROPERTY_TRACK_REUSABLE_BUFFERS\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#SYSTEM_PROPERTY_TRACK_REUSABLE_BUFFERS\"></xref>). This method is usually called on shutdown of the container like Application Server to ensure that no references are reachable via <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ThreadLocal\"></xref>s as this may cause unintentional retention of sizable amounts of memory. It may also be called regularly if GC for some reason does not clear up <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"SoftReference\"></xref>s aggressively enough."
  syntax: "public static int releaseBuffers()"
  returns:
    description: "Number of buffers released, if tracking enabled (zero or more); -1 if tracking not enabled."
