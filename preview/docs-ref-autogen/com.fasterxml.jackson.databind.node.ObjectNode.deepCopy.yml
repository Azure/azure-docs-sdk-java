  summary: "Method that can be called to get a node that is guaranteed not to allow changing of this node through mutators on this node or any of its children. This means it can either make a copy of this node (and all mutable children and grand children nodes), or node itself if it is immutable.\n\nNote: return type is guaranteed to have same type as the node method is called on; which is why method is declared with local generic type."
