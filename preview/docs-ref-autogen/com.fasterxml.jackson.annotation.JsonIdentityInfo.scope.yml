  summary: "Scope is used to define applicability of an Object Id: all ids must be unique within their scope; where scope is defined as combination of this value and generator type. Comparison is simple equivalence, meaning that both type generator type and scope class must be the same.\n\nScope is used for determining how many generators are needed; more than one scope is typically only needed if external Object Ids have overlapping value domains (i.e. are only unique within some limited scope)"
