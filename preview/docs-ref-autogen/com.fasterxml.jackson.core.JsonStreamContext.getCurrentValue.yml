  summary: "Method for accessing currently active value being used by data-binding (as the source of streaming data to write, or destination of data being read), at this level in hierarchy.\n\nNote that \"current value\" is NOT populated (or used) by Streaming parser or generator; it is only used by higher-level data-binding functionality. The reason it is included here is that it can be stored and accessed hierarchically, and gets passed through data-binding."
