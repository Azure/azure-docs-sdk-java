  summary: "Writes the map data to the stream. This method must be overridden if a subclass must be setup before `put()` is used.\n\nSerialization is not one of the JDK's nicest topics. Normal serialization will initialise the superclass before the subclass. Sometimes however, this isn't what you want, as in this case the `put()` method on read can be affected by subclass state.\n\nThe solution adopted here is to serialize the state data of this class in this protected method. This method must be called by the `writeObject()` of the first serializable subclass.\n\nSubclasses may override if they have a specific field that must be present on read before this implementation will work. Generally, the read determines what must be serialized here, if anything."
