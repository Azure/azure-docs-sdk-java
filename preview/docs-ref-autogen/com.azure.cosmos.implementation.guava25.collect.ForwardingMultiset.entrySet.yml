  summary: "Returns a view of the contents of this multiset, grouped into `Multiset.Entry` instances, each providing an element of the multiset and the count of that element. This set contains exactly one entry for each distinct element in the multiset (thus it always has the same size as the <xref uid=\"com.azure.cosmos.implementation.guava25.collect.ForwardingMultiset.elementSet\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#elementSet\"></xref>). The order of the elements in the element set is unspecified.\n\nThe entry set is backed by the same data as the multiset, so any change to either is immediately reflected in the other. However, multiset changes may or may not be reflected in any `Entry` instances already retrieved from the entry set (this is implementation-dependent). Furthermore, implementations are not required to support modifications to the entry set at all, and the `Entry` instances themselves don't even have methods for modification. See the specific implementation class for more details on how its entry set handles modifications."
