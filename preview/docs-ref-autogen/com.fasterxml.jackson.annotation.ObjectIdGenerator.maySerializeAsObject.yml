  summary: "Accessor that needs to be overridden to return `true` if the Object Id may be serialized as JSON Object; used by, for example, JSOG handling. The reason accessor is needed is because handling such Object Ids is more complex and may incur additional buffering or performance overhead, avoiding of which makes sense for common case of scalar object ids (or native object ids some formats support).\n\nDefault implementation returns `false`, so needs to be overridden by Object-producing generators."
