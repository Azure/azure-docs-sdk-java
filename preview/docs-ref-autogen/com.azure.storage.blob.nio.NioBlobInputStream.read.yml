  summary: "Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255.

  summary: "Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array `b`. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. If the length of `b` is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the end of the file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into `b`. The first byte read is stored into element `b[0]`, the next one into `b[1]`, and so on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to the length of `b`. Let `k` be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements `b[0]` through `b[k-1]`, leaving elements `b[k]` through `b[b.length-1]` unaffected. The `read(b)` method for class <xref uid=\"java.io.InputStream\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"InputStream\"></xref> has the same effect as: `read(b, 0, b.length)`"

  summary: "Reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as `len` bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. If `len` is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte.
