summary: "Marker annotation that can be used on a property accessor (field, getter or setter, constructor parameter) to indicate that the property is to contain type id to use when including polymorphic type information. Annotation should **only be used** if the intent is to override generation of standard type id: if so, value of the property will be accessed during serialization and used as the type id.\n\nOn deserialization annotation has no effect, as visibility of type id is governed by value of <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo.visible*\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonTypeInfo#visible\"></xref>; properties with this annotation get no special handling.\n\nOn serialization, this annotation will exclude property from being serialized along other properties; instead, its value is serialized as the type identifier. Since type identifier may be included in various places, it may still appear like 'normal' property (when using <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonTypeInfo.As#PROPERTY\"></xref>), but is more commonly embedded in a different place, as per inclusion rules (see <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"JsonTypeInfo\"></xref> for details)."
