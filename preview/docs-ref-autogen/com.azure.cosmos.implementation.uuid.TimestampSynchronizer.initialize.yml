  summary: "Initialization method is will be called on an instance by <xref uid=\"com.azure.cosmos.implementation.uuid.UUIDTimer\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"UUIDTimer\"></xref> right after it's been configured with one. At this point the implementation instance should have been properly configured, and should be able to determine the first legal timestamp value (return value). Method should also initialize any locking that it does (if any), such as locking files it needs.\n\nReturn value thus indicates the lowest initial time value that can be used by the caller that can not have been used by previous incarnations of the UUID generator (assuming instance was able to find properly persisted data to figure that out). However, caller also needs to make sure that it will call <xref uid=\"com.azure.cosmos.implementation.uuid.TimestampSynchronizer.update*\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#update\"></xref> when it actually needs the time stamp for the first time, since this method can not allocate timestamps beyond this initial value at this point."
