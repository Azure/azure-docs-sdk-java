  summary: "This variant is what most people would think of \"the standard\" Base64 encoding.\n\nSee [wikipedia Base64 entry][] for details.\n\nNote that although this can be thought of as the standard variant, it is **not** the default for Jackson: no-linefeeds alternative is because of JSON requirement of escaping all linefeeds.\n\n\n[wikipedia Base64 entry]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"
