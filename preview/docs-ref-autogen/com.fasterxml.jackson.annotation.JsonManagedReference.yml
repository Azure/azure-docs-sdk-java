  summary: >-
    Annotation used to indicate that annotated property is part of two-way linkage between fields; and that its role is "parent" (or "forward") link. Value type (class) of property must have a single compatible property annotated with <xref uid="com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonBackReference" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">JsonBackReference</xref>. Linkage is handled such that the property annotated with this annotation is handled normally (serialized normally, no special handling for deserialization); it is the matching back reference that requires special handling


    All references have logical name to allow handling multiple linkages; typical case would be that where nodes have both parent/child and sibling linkages. If so, pairs of references should be named differently. It is an error for a class too have multiple managed references with same name, even if types pointed are different.


    Note: only methods and fields can be annotated with this annotation: constructor arguments should NOT be annotated, as they can not be either managed or back references.

  summary: Logical have for the reference property pair; used to link managed and back references. Default name can be used if there is just single reference pair (for example, node class that just has parent/child linkage, consisting of one managed reference and matching back reference)
