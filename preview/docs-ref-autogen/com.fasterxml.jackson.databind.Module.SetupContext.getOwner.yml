  summary: "Fallback access method that allows modules to refer to the <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ObjectMapper\"></xref> that provided this context. It should NOT be needed by most modules; and ideally should not be used -- however, there may be cases where this may be necessary due to various design constraints.\n\nNOTE: use of this method is discouraged, as it allows access to things Modules typically should not modify. It is included, however, to allow access to new features in cases where Module API has not yet been extended, or there are oversights.\n\nReturn value is chosen to not leak dependency to <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ObjectMapper\"></xref>; however, instance will always be of that type. This is why return value is declared generic, to allow caller to specify context to often avoid casting."
