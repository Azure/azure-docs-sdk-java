  summary: >-
    Interface for deciding how long a connection can remain idle before being reused.


    Implementations of this interface must be thread-safe. Access to shared data must be synchronized as methods of this interface may be executed from multiple threads.

  overload: org.apache.hc.client5.http.ConnectionKeepAliveStrategy.getKeepAliveDuration*
  type: Method
  package: org.apache.hc.client5.http
  summary: >-
    Returns the duration of time which this connection can be safely kept idle. If the connection is left idle for longer than this period of time, it MUST not reused. A value of 0 or less may be returned to indicate that there is no suitable suggestion. When coupled with a <xref uid="org.apache.hc.core5.http.ConnectionReuseStrategy" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">org.apache.hc.core5.http.ConnectionReuseStrategy</xref>, if <xref uid="org.apache.hc.core5.http.ConnectionReuseStrategy#keepAlive(
     org.apache.hc.core5.http.HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpContext)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">org.apache.hc.core5.http.ConnectionReuseStrategy#keepAlive(
     org.apache.hc.core5.http.HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpContext)</xref> returns true, this allows you to control how long the reuse will last. If keepAlive returns false, this should have no meaningful impact
