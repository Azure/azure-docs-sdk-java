Event Processor-based application consists of one or more instances of EventProcessorClient(s) which are set up to consume events from the same Event Hub, consumer group to balance the workload across different instances and track progress when events are processed. Based on the number of instances running, each EventProcessorClient may own zero or more partitions to balance the workload among all the instances.\n\nTo create an instance of EventProcessorClient, use the fluent <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.EventProcessorClientBuilder\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"EventProcessorClientBuilder\"></xref>."
