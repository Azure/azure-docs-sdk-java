  summary: "This is a default mapping of the 26 letters used in US English. A value of `0` for a letter position means do not encode, but treat as a separator when it occurs between consonants with the same code.\n\n(This constant is provided as both an implementation convenience and to allow Javadoc to pick up the value for the constant values page.)\n\n**Note that letters H and W are treated specially.** They are ignored (after the first letter) and don't act as separators between consonants with the same code."
