  summary: >-
    Specifies the capacity (number of instances) for the application gateway. The API refers to this as "Capacity", but the portal and the docs refer to this as "instance count", so using that naming here


    By default, 1 instance is used.

    parameters:
    - id: instanceCount
      type: int
      description: >-
        the capacity as a number between 1 and 10 but also based on the limits imposed by
             the selected application gateway size
