  summary: "Copies the resource at the source location to the destination.\n\nThis method is not atomic with respect to other file system operations. More specifically, the checks necessary to validate the inputs and state of the file system are not atomic with the actual copying of data. If the copy is triggered, the copy itself is atomic and only a complete copy will ever be left at the destination.\n\nIn addition to those in the docs for <xref uid=\"java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider.copy*\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">FileSystemProvider#copy(Path, Path, CopyOption...)</xref>, this method has the following requirements for successful completion. <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">StandardCopyOption#COPY_ATTRIBUTES</xref> must be passed as it is impossible not to copy blob properties; if this option is not passed, an <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">UnsupportedOperationException</xref> will be thrown. Neither the source nor the destination can be a root directory; if either is a root directory, an <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">IllegalArgumentException</xref> will be thrown. The parent directory of the destination must at least weakly exist; if it does not, an <xref uid=\"java.io.IOException\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">IOException</xref> will be thrown. The only supported option other than <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">StandardCopyOption#COPY_ATTRIBUTES</xref> is <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">StandardCopyOption#REPLACE_EXISTING</xref>; the presence of any other option will result in an <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">UnsupportedOperationException</xref>.\n\nThis method supports both virtual and concrete directories as both the source and destination. Unlike when creating a directory, the existence of a virtual directory at the destination will cause this operation to fail. This is in order to prevent the possibility of overwriting a non-empty virtual directory with a file. Still, as mentioned above, this check is not atomic with the creation of the resultant directory."
