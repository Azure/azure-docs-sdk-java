summary: "Annotation used for indicating view(s) that the property that is defined by method or field annotated is part of.\n\nAn example annotation would be:\n\n```java\n@JsonView(BasicView.class)\n```\n\nwhich would specify that property annotated would be included when processing (serializing, deserializing) View identified by `BasicView.class` (or its sub-class). If multiple View class identifiers are included, property will be part of all of them.\n\nStarting with 2.9, it is also possible to use this annotation on POJO classes to indicate the default view(s) for properties of the type, unless overridden by per-property annotation."
