  summary: "Method called to check whether root-level value, at current output location, should be included in output. Three kinds of return values may be used as follows:\n\n *  `null` to indicate that the root value should be skipped\n *  <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.filter.TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#INCLUDE_ALL\"></xref> to indicate that the root value should be included completely in output\n *  Any other <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.filter.TokenFilter\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"TokenFilter\"></xref> implementation (possibly this one) to mean that further inclusion calls on returned filter object need to be made as necessary, to determine inclusion.\n\nThe default implementation simply returns `this` to continue calling methods on this filter object, without full inclusion or exclusion."
