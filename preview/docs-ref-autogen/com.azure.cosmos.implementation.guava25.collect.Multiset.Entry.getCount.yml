  summary: "Returns the count of the associated element in the underlying multiset. This count may either be an unchanging snapshot of the count at the time the entry was retrieved, or a live view of the current count of the element in the multiset, depending on the implementation. Note that in the former case, this method can never return zero, while in the latter, it will return zero if all occurrences of the element were since removed from the multiset."
  syntax: "public abstract int getCount()"
  returns:
    description: "the count of the element; never negative"
