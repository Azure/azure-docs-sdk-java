summary: "Annotation used to indicate that associated property is part of two-way linkage between fields; and that its role is \"child\" (or \"back\") link. Value type of the property must be a bean: it can not be a Collection, Map, Array or enumeration. Linkage is handled such that the property annotated with this annotation is not serialized; and during deserialization, its value is set to instance that has the \"managed\" (forward) link.\n\nAll references have logical name to allow handling multiple linkages; typical case would be that where nodes have both parent/child and sibling linkages. If so, pairs of references should be named differently. It is an error for a class to have multiple back references with same name, even if types pointed are different.\n\nNote: only methods and fields can be annotated with this annotation: constructor arguments should NOT be annotated, as they can not be either managed or back references."
