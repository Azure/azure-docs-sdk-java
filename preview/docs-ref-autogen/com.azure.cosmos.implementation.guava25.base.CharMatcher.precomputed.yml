  summary: "Returns a `char` matcher functionally equivalent to this one, but which may be faster to query than the original; your mileage may vary. Precomputation takes time and is likely to be worthwhile only if the precomputed matcher is queried many thousands of times.\n\nThis method has no effect (returns `this`) when called in GWT: it's unclear whether a precomputed matcher is faster, but it certainly consumes more memory, which doesn't seem like a worthwhile tradeoff in a browser."
