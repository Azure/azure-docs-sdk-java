  summary: "Simple utility method to use to wait for couple of milliseconds, to let system clock hopefully advance closer to the virtual timestamps used. Delay is kept to just a millisecond or two, to prevent excessive blocking; but that should be enough to eventually synchronize physical clock with virtual clock values used for UUIDs."
