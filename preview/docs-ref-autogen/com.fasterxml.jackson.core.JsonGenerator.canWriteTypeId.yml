  summary: "Introspection method that may be called to see if the underlying data format supports some kind of Type Ids natively (many do not; for example, JSON doesn't). This method **must** be called prior to calling <xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerator.writeTypeId*\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#writeTypeId\"></xref>.\n\nDefault implementation returns false; overridden by data formats that do support native Type Ids. Caller is expected to either use a non-native notation (explicit property or such), or fail, in case it can not use native type ids."
