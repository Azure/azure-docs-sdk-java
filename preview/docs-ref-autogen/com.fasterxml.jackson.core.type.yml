summary: "Contains classes needed for type introspection, mostly used by data binding\n functionality. Most of this functionality is needed to properly handled\n generic types, and to simplify and unify processing of things Jackson needs\n to determine how contained types (of <xref uid=\"java.util.Collection\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"java.util.Collection\"></xref> and\n <xref uid=\"java.util.Map\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"java.util.Map\"></xref> classes) are to be handled.\n<p>\n With 2.9, an additional type (<xref uid=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.WritableTypeId\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.WritableTypeId\"></xref>)\n was added to help handling of type identifiers needed to support polymorphic\n type serialization, deserialization."
