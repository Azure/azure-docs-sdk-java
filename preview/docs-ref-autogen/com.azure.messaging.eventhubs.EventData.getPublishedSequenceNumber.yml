  summary: "Gets the producer sequence number that was assigned during publishing, if the event was successfully published by a sequence-aware producer. If the producer was not configured to apply sequence numbering or if the event has not yet been successfully published, this member will be `null`. The published sequence number is only populated and relevant when certain features of the producer are enabled. For example, it is used by idempotent publishing."
