  summary: "An alternate form of `put` that silently removes any existing entry with the value `value` before proceeding with the <xref uid=\"com.azure.cosmos.implementation.guava25.collect.BiMap.put\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#put\"></xref> operation. If the bimap previously contained the provided key-value mapping, this method has no effect.\n\nNote that a successful call to this method could cause the size of the bimap to increase by one, stay the same, or even decrease by one.\n\n**Warning:** If an existing entry with this value is removed, the key for that entry is discarded and not returned."
  parameters:
  - description: "the key with which the specified value is to be associated"
    name: "key"
    type: "<xref href=\"K?alt=K&text=K\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"False\" />"

  syntax: "public abstract V forcePut(K key, V value)"
  returns:
    description: "the value which was previously associated with the key, which may be <code>null</code>, or\n     <code>null</code> if there was no previous entry"
