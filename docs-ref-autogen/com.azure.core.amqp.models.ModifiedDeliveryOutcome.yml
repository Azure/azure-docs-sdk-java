summary: "The modified outcome.\n\nAt the source the modified outcome means that the message is no longer acquired by the receiver, and has been made available for (re-)delivery to the same or other targets receiving from the node. The message has been changed at the node in the ways indicated by the fields of the outcome. As modified is a terminal outcome, transfer of payload data will not be able to be resumed if the link becomes suspended. A delivery can become modified at the source even before all transfer frames have been sent. This does not imply that the remaining transfers for the delivery will not be sent. The source MAY spontaneously attain the modified outcome for a message (for example the source might implement some sort of time-bound acquisition lock, after which the acquisition of a message at a node is revoked to allow for delivery to an alternative consumer with the message modified in some way to denote the previous failed, e.g., with delivery-failed set to true).\n\nAt the target, the modified outcome is used to indicate that a given transfer was not and will not be acted upon, and that the message SHOULD be modified in the specified ways at the node."
