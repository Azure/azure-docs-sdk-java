If the URL points to Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes. There are three ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read permissions on the blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL for the blob or its container to allow public access."
