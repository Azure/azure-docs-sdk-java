  summary: "Get the httpUrl property: The URL of the file to download. The autoStorageContainerName, storageContainerUrl and httpUrl properties are mutually exclusive and one of them must be specified. If the URL points to Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes. There are three ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read permissions on the blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL for the blob or its container to allow public access."
