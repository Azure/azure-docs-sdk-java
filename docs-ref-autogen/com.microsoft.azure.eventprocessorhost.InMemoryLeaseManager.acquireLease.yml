  summary: >-
    <p>Acquire the lease on the desired partition for this EventProcessorHost. </p>

    <p>Note that it is legal to acquire a lease that is currently owned by another host, which is called "stealing". Lease-stealing is how partitions are redistributed when additional hosts are started. </p>

    <p>The existing Azure Storage implementation can experience races between two host instances attempting to acquire or steal the lease at the same time. To avoid situations where two host instances both believe that they own the lease, acquisition can fail non-exceptionally by returning false and should do so when there is any doubt <ndash></ndash> the worst that can happen is that no host instance owns the lease for a short time. This is qualitatively different from, for example, the underlying store throwing an access exception, which is an error and should complete exceptionally.</p>
