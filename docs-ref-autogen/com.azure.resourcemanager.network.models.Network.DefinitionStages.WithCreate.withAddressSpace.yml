  summary: "Explicitly adds an address space to the virtual network.\n\nIf no address spaces are explicitly specified, a default address space with the CIDR \"10.0.0.0/16\" will be assigned to the virtual network.\n\nNote that this method's effect is additive, i.e. each time it is used, a new address space is added to the network. This method does not check for conflicts or overlaps with other address spaces. If there is a conflict, a cloud exception may be thrown at the time the network is created."
