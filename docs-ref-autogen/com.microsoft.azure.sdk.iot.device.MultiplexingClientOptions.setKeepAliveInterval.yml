  summary: >-
    <p>Sets the keep alive interval in seconds. This value defines the maximum time interval between messages sent or received. It enables the client to detect if the server is no longer available, without having to wait for the TCP/IP timeout. The client will ensure that at least one message travels across the network within each keep alive period. In the absence of a data-related message during the time period, the client sends a very small "ping" message, which the server will acknowledge. The default value is 230 seconds.</p>
