    description: <p>A future that will complete when input processing has been stopped. Result generation, if applicable for the input provided, may happen after this task completes and should be handled with the appropriate event. </p>
    type: <xref href="Future%3CVoid%3E?alt=Future%3CVoid%3E&text=Future%3CVoid%3E" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False"/>
  summary: <p>Stops a running recognition operation as soon as possible and immediately requests a result based on the the input that has been processed so far. This works for all recognition operations, not just continuous ones, and facilitates the use of push-to-talk or "finish now" buttons for manual audio endpointing. </p>
