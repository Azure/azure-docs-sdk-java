  summary: "Gets called after receiving response from CosmosDb. Response Diagnostics are collected from API responses and then set in <xref uid=\"com.azure.spring.data.cosmos.core.ResponseDiagnostics\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">ResponseDiagnostics</xref> object.\n\nIn case of missing diagnostics from CosmosDb, responseDiagnostics will be null.\n\nNOTE: Since processResponseDiagnostics() API will get called in every cosmos spring data implementation API to capture the diagnostics details, it is highly recommended to not have any long running / CPU intensive work in the implementation of this API."
