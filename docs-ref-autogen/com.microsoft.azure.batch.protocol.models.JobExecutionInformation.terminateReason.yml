  summary: "Get this property is set only if the Job is in the completed state. If the Batch service terminates the Job, it sets the reason as follows: JMComplete - the Job Manager Task completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry - the Job reached its maxWallClockTime constraint. TerminateJobSchedule - the Job ran as part of a schedule, and the schedule terminated. AllTasksComplete - the Job's onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminatejob, and all Tasks in the Job are complete. TaskFailed - the Job's onTaskFailure attribute is set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a Task in the Job failed with an exit condition that specified a jobAction of terminatejob. Any other string is a user-defined reason specified in a call to the 'Terminate a Job' operation."
