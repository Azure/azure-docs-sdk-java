  summary: "Allows and starts the use of this network's gateway by the remote network (a.k.a. gateway transit).\n\nIf the remote network is not in the same subscription as this network, then gateway use by the remote gateway will only be allowed on this network, but not started. The matching peering on the remote network must be modified explicitly to start it.\n\nIf this network is currently configured to use the remote network's gateway, that use will be automatically disabled, as these two settings cannot be used together.\n\nBefore gateway use by a remote network can be started, a working gateway must already be in place within this network."
