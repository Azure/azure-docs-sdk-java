  summary: "The maximum number of parallel requests that will be issued at any given time as a part of a single parallel transfer. This value applies per api. For example, if two calls to uploadFromFile are made at the same time, and each specifies a maxConcurrency of 5, there may be up to 10 outstanding, concurrent requests, up to 5 for each of the upload operations. For buffered uploads only, the maximum number of buffers to be allocated as part of the transfer will be `maxConcurrency + 1`. In those cases, memory will be allocated lazily as needed. The amount of memory consumed by methods which buffer may be up to blockSize \\* maxConcurrency. In general, upload methods which do not accept a length parameter must perform some buffering."
