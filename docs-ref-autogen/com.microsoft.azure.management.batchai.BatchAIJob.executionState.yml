  summary: "Gets the current state of the job. Possible values are: queued - The job is queued and able to run. A job enters this state when it is created, or when it is awaiting a retry after a failed run. running - The job is running on a compute cluster. This includes job-level preparation such as downloading resource files or set up container specified on the job - it does not necessarily mean that the job command line has started executing. terminating - The job is terminated by the user, the terminate operation is in progress. succeeded - The job has completed running succesfully and exited with exit code 0. failed - The job has finished unsuccessfully (failed with a non-zero exit code) and has exhausted its retry limit. A job is also marked as failed if an error occurred launching the job."
