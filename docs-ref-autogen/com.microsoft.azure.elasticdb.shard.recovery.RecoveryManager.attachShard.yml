    <p>Attaches a shard to the shard map manager. Earlier versions of mappings for the same shard map will automatically be updated if more recent versions are found on the shard to be attached. After attaching a shard, DetectMappingDifferences(ShardLocation, string) should be called to check for any inconsistencies that warrant manual conflict resolution.</p>
