  summary: "Deletes a Job. Deleting a Job also deletes all Tasks that are part of that Job, and all Job statistics. This also overrides the retention period for Task data; that is, if the Job contains Tasks which are still retained on Compute Nodes, the Batch services deletes those Tasks' working directories and all their contents.
