  summary: "Sets the `ownerLevel` value on this receive operation. When populated, the level indicates that the receive operation is intended to be the only reader of events for the requested partition and associated consumer group. To do so, this receive operation will attempt to assert ownership over the partition; in the case where there is more than one exclusive receive operation for the same partition/consumer group pair, the one having a larger <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.models.ReceiveOptions.getOwnerLevel()\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ReceiveOptions#getOwnerLevel()\"></xref> value will \"win\".\n\nWhen an exclusive receive operation is used, those receive operations which are not exclusive or which have a lower priority will either not be allowed to be created. If they already exist, will encounter an exception during the next attempted operation."

  - description: "The priority associated with an exclusive receive operation; for a non-exclusive receive\n     operation, this value should be <code>null</code>."
