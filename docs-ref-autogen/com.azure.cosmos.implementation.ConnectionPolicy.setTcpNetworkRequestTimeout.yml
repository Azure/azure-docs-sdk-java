  summary: "Sets the tcp network request timeout interval (time to wait for response from network peer). Default value is 5 seconds. It only allows values ?5s and ?10s. (backend allows requests to take up-to 5 seconds processing time - 5 seconds buffer so 10 seconds in total for transport is more than sufficient). Attention! Please adjust this value with caution. This config represents the max time allowed to wait for and consume a service response after the request has been written to the network connection. Setting a value too low can result in having not enough time to wait for the service response - which could cause too aggressive retries and degrade performance. Setting a value too high can result in fewer retries and reduce chances of success by retries."
