  summary: >-
    <p>Given a collection of shard locations, reconstructs the shard map manager based on mapping information stored in the individual shards. The specified shards need to be registered already in the global shard map. This method only rebuilds mappings. It does not rebuild shard membership within the global shard map. If the information in the individual shard maps is or becomes inconsistent, the behavior is undefined. No cross shard locks are taken, so if any shards become inconsistent during the execution of this method, the final state of the global shard map may be corrupt.</p>
