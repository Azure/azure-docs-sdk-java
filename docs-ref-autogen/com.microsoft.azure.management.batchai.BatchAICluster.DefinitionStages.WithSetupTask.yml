summary: "Specifies a setup task which can be used to customize the compute nodes of the cluster. The task runs everytime a VM is rebooted. For that reason the task code needs to be idempotent. Generally it is used to either download static data that is required for all jobs that run on the cluster VMs or to download/install software. NOTE: The volumes specified in mountVolumes are mounted first and then the setupTask is run. Therefore the setup task can use local mountPaths in its execution."
