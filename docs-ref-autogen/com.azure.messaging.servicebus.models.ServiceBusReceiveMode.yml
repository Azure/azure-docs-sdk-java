  summary: "In this mode, received message is not deleted from the queue or subscription, instead it is temporarily locked to the receiver, making it invisible to other receivers. Then the service waits for one of the following events:\n\n *  If the receiver processes the message successfully, it calls <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverClient.complete(com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ServiceBusReceiverClient#complete(ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\"></xref> or <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient.complete(com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient#complete(ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\"></xref> and the message will be deleted.\n *  If the receiver decides that it can't process the message successfully, it calls <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverClient.abandon(com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ServiceBusReceiverClient#abandon(ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\"></xref> or <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient.abandon(com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient#abandon(ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\"></xref> and the message will be unlocked and made available to other receivers.\n *  If the receiver wants to defer the processing of the message to a later point in time, it calls <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverClient.defer(com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ServiceBusReceiverClient#defer(ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\"></xref> or <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient.defer(com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient#defer(ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\"></xref> and the message will be deferred. A deferred can only be received by its sequence number.\n *  If the receiver wants to dead-letter the message, it calls <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverClient.deadLetter(com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ServiceBusReceiverClient#deadLetter(ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\"></xref> or <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient.deadLetter(com.azure.messaging.servicebus.ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"ServiceBusReceiverAsyncClient#deadLetter(ServiceBusReceivedMessage)\"></xref> and the message will be moved to a special sub-queue called dead-letter queue.\n *  If the receiver calls neither of these methods within a configurable period of time (by default, 60 seconds), the service assumes the receiver has failed. In this case, it behaves as if the receiver had called `abandon`, making the message available to other receivers"
