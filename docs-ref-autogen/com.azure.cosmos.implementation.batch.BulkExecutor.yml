summary: "The Core logic of bulk execution is here. The actual execution of the flux of operations. It is done in following steps: 1. Getting partition key range ID and grouping operations using that id. 2. For the flux of operations in a group, adding buffering based on size and a duration. 3. For the operation we get in after buffering, process it using a batch request and return a wrapper having request, response(if-any) and exception(if-any). Either response or exception will be there. 4. Any internal retry is done by adding in an intermediate sink for each grouped flux. 5. Any operation which failed due to partition key range gone is retried by putting it in the main sink which leads to re-calculation of partition key range id. 6. At the end and this is very essential, we close all the sinks as the sink continues to waits for more and the execution isn't finished even if all the operations have been executed(figured out by completion call of source) Note: Sink will move to a new interface from 3.5 and this is documentation for it: - https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/blob/master/docs/asciidoc/processors.adoc For our use case, Sinks.many().unicast() will work."
