  summary: "Stops and disallows the use of this network's gateway by the remote network.\n\nIf the remote network is not in the same subscription, then the use of that network's gateway by this network will be stopped but not disallowed by the remote network. The matching peering on the remote network must still be explicitly updated to also disallow such use."
