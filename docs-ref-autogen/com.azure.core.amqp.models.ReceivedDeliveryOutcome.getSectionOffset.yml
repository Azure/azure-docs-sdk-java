  summary: "Gets the section offset.\n\nWhen sent by the sender this indicates the first byte of the encoded section data of the section given by section-number for which data can be resent (with section-offset 0 being the first byte). Bytes from the same section prior to the given offset section cannot be retransmitted for this delivery.\n\nWhen sent by the receiver this indicates the first byte of the given section which has not yet been received. Note that if a receiver has received all of section number X (which contains N bytes of data), but none of section number X + 1, then it can indicate this by sending either Received(section-number=X, section-offset=N) or Received(section-number=X+1, section-offset=0). The state Received(section-number=0, section-offset=0) indicates that no message data at all has been transferred."
