summary: "This interface defines methods and properties that are inherited from the instantiating parent object. Classes that implement this interface inherit behaviors when they are instantiated. In this model, the collections are independent but the members are shared references. Members of this collection alter or customize various behaviors of Azure Batch service client objects. These behaviors are generally inherited by any child class instances. Modifications are applied in the order of the collection. The last write wins."
