summary: "Annotation given to some tests to indicate that network calls made during the test shouldn't be recorded.\n\nPass `true` for <xref uid=\"com.azure.core.test.annotation.DoNotRecord.skipInPlayback()\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"skipInPlayback\"></xref> to indicate that the test shouldn't run when tests are ran in <xref uid=\"com.azure.core.test.TestMode.PLAYBACK\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"TestMode#PLAYBACK\"></xref>. A common case for setting this to `true` is when the test has either sensitive content that cannot be redacted or calls into code that cannot be mocked."
