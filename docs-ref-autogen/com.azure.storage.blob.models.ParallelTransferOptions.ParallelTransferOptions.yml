  - description: "The maximum number of parallel requests that will be issued at any given time as a part of\n a single parallel transfer. This value applies per api. For example, if two calls to uploadFromFile are made at\n the same time, and each specifies a maxConcurrency of 5, there may be up to 10 outstanding, concurrent requests,\n up to 5 for each of the upload operations. For buffered uploads only, the maximum number of buffers to be\n allocated as part of the transfer will be <code>maxConcurrency + 1</code>. In those cases, memory will be allocated\n lazily as needed. The amount of memory consumed by methods which buffer may be up to blockSize * maxConcurrency.\n In general, upload methods which do not accept a length parameter must perform some buffering."
