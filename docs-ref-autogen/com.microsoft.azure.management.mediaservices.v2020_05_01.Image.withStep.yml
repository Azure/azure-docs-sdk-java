  desc: "Set the intervals at which thumbnails are generated. The value can be in ISO 8601 format (For example, PT05S for one image every 5 seconds), or a frame count (For example, 30 for one image every 30 frames), or a relative value to stream duration (For example, 10% for one image every 10% of stream duration). Note: Step value will affect the first generated thumbnail, which may not be exactly the one specified at transform preset start time. This is due to the encoder, which tries to select the best thumbnail between start time and Step position from start time as the first output. As the default value is 10%, it means if stream has long duration, the first generated thumbnail might be far away from the one specified at start time. Try to select reasonable value for Step if the first thumbnail is expected close to start time, or set Range value at 1 if only one thumbnail is needed at start time."
