  summary: "Get the activitySourceHost property: Required. URL for the domain representing the cross-platform identity mapping for the app. Mapping is stored either as a JSON file hosted on the domain or configurable via Windows Dev Center. The JSON file is named cross-platform-app-identifiers and is hosted at root of your HTTPS domain, either at the top level domain or include a sub domain. For example: https://contoso.com or https://myapp.contoso.com but NOT https://myapp.contoso.com/somepath. You must have a unique file and domain (or sub domain) per cross-platform app identity. For example, a separate file and domain is needed for Word vs. PowerPoint."
