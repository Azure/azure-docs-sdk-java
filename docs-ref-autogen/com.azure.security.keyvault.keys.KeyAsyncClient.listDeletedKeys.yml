  summary: "Lists <xref uid=\"com.azure.security.keyvault.keys.models.DeletedKey\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"deleted keys\"></xref> of the key vault. The deleted keys are retrieved as JSON Web Key structures that contain the public part of a deleted key. The Get Deleted Keys operation is applicable for vaults enabled for soft-delete. This operation requires the `keys/list` permission.\n\n**Code Samples**\n\nLists the deleted keys in the key vault. Subscribes to the call asynchronously and prints out the recovery id of each deleted key when a response has been received.\n\n```java\nkeyAsyncClient.listDeletedKeys()\n     .subscriberContext(Context.of(key1, value1, key2, value2))\n     .subscribe(deletedKey  -> System.out.printf(\"Deleted key's recovery Id %s\", deletedKey.getRecoveryId()));\n```"
