  summary: "Sets whether or not the receive operation should request information on the last enqueued event on its associated partition, and track that information as events are received.\n\nWhen information about the partition's last enqueued event is being tracked, each event received from the Event Hubs service will carry metadata about the partition that it otherwise would not. This results in a small amount of additional network bandwidth consumption that is generally a favorable trade-off when considered against periodically making requests for partition properties using the Event Hub client."
  parameters:
  - description: "<code>true</code> if the resulting events will keep track of the last\n     enqueued information for that partition; <code>false</code> otherwise."
