Users can optionally call openConnection() to manually set up a connection in advance before starting recognition on the Recognizer associated with this Connection. After starting recognition, calling OpenConnection() might fail, depending on the process state of the Recognizer. But the failure does not affect the state of the associated Recognizer. Note: On return, the connection might not be ready yet. Please subscribe to the Connected event to be notfied when the connection is established. </p>'
