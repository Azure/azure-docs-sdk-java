  summary: >-
    <p>Represents a correlation filter expression. A correlation filter is an efficient shortcut for declarations of filters that deal only with correlation equality of message properties. A correlation filter can be created to match one or more of standard or custom properties of a message. In the service, correlation filters are implemented as hashtable lookups. So they are much faster at run time than other types of filters.</p>
