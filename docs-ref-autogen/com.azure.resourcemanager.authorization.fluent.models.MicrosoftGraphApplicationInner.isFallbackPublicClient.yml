  summary: "Get the isFallbackPublicClient property: Specifies the fallback application type as public client, such as an installed application running on a mobile device. The default value is false which means the fallback application type is confidential client such as web app. There are certain scenarios where Azure AD cannot determine the client application type (e.g. ROPC flow where it is configured without specifying a redirect URI). In those cases Azure AD will interpret the application type based on the value of this property."
