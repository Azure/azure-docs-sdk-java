  summary: "<p>Anonymous credentials are to be used with with HTTP(S) requests that read blobs from public containers or requests that use a Shared Access Signature (SAS). This is because Anonymous credentials will not set an Authorization header. Pass an instance of this class as the credentials parameter when creating a new pipeline (typically with <xref uid=\"com.microsoft.azure.storage.blob.StorageURL\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">StorageURL</xref>). </p>"

  summary: "<p>SharedKeyCredentials are a means of signing and authenticating storage requests. The key can be obtained from the Azure portal. This factory will create policies which take care of all the details of creating strings to sign, signing them, and setting the Authentication header. While this is a common way of authenticating with the service, recommended practice is using <xref uid=\"com.microsoft.azure.storage.blob.TokenCredentials\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">TokenCredentials</xref>. Pass this as the credentials in the construction of a new <xref uid=\"\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">HttpPipeline</xref> via the <xref uid=\"com.microsoft.azure.storage.blob.StorageURL\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\">StorageURL</xref> type. </p>"
