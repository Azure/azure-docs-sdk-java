  summary: "Allows traffic forwarding both from either peered network to the other.\n\nThis setting will have effect on the remote network only if the remote network is in the same subscription. Otherwise, it will be ignored and you need to change the corresponding traffic forwarding setting on the remote network's matching peering explicitly."
