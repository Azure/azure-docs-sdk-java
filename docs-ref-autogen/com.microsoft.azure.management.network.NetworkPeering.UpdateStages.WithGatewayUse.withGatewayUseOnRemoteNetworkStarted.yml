  summary: "Starts the use of the remote network's gateway.\n\nIf the remote network is in the same subscription, remote gateway use by this network (a.k.a. gateway transit) will also be automatically allowed on the remote network's side. Otherwise, this network will only be configured to use the remote gateway, but the matching peering on the remote network must still be additionally modified explicitly to allow gateway use by this network.\n\nIf this network is currently configured to allow the remote network to use its gateway, that use will be automatically disabled, as these two settings cannot be used together.\n\nBefore gateway use on a remote network can be started, a working gateway must already be in place within the remote network."
