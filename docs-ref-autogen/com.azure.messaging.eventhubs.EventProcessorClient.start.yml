  summary: "Starts processing of events for all partitions of the Event Hub that this event processor can own, assigning a dedicated <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.implementation.PartitionProcessor\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"PartitionProcessor\"></xref> to each partition. If there are other Event Processors active for the same consumer group on the Event Hub, responsibility for partitions will be shared between them.\n\nSubsequent calls to start will be ignored if this event processor is already running. Calling start after <xref uid=\"com.azure.messaging.eventhubs.EventProcessorClient.stop()\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"#stop()\"></xref> is called will restart this event processor.\n\n**Starting the processor to consume events from all partitions**\n\n```java\neventProcessorClient.start();\n // Continue to perform other tasks while the processor is running in the background.\n eventProcessorClient.stop();\n```"
