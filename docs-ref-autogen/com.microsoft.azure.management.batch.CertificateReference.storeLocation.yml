  summary: "Get the default value is currentUser. This property is applicable only for pools configured with Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ\\_BATCH\\_CERTIFICATES\\_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/\\{user-name\\}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory. Possible values include: 'CurrentUser', 'LocalMachine'."
