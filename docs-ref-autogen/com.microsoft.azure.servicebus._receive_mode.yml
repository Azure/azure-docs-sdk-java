A deferred can only be received by its sequence number. </p></li><li><p>If the receiver wants to dead-letter the message, it calls  and the message will be moved to a special sub-queue called deadletter queue. </p></li><li><p>If the receiver calls neither of these methods within a configurable period of time (by default, 60 seconds), the service assumes the receiver has failed.
