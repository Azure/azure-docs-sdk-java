When your WAF receives a request that's over the size limit, the behavior depends on the mode of your WAF and the version of the managed ruleset you use.\n\n *  When your WAF policy is in prevention mode, WAF logs and blocks requests that are over the size limit.\n *  When your WAF policy is in detection mode, WAF inspects the body up to the limit specified and ignores the rest. If the Content-Length header is present and is greater than the file upload limit, WAF ignores the entire body and logs the request."
