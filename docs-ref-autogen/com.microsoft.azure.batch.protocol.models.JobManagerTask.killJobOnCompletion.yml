  summary: >-
    <p>Get if true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution. The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.</p>
