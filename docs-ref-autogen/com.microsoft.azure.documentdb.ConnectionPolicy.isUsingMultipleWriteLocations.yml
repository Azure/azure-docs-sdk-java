  summary: "Gets the flag to enable writes on any locations (regions) for geo-replicated database accounts in the Azure Cosmos DB service. When the value of this property is true, the SDK will direct write operations to available writable locations of geo-replicated database account. Writable locations are ordered by PreferredLocations property. Setting the property value to true has no effect until EnableMultipleWriteLocations in DatabaseAccount is also set to true. Default value is false indicating that writes are only directed to first region in PreferredLocations property."
