The fact that the Primary has changed is not directly visible to Secondary replicas, which are usually unaffected by the failure that affected the original Primary replica.

    <p>

      <bold>Remarks:</bold>The Primary replica analyzes the context and sends back state via <xref href="system.fabric._state_provider.getCopyState(SequenceNumber,OperationDataStream)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> . <xref href="system.fabric._state_provider.getCopyContext()" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> is called on newly created, idle Secondary replicas and provides a mechanism to asynchronously establish a bidirectional conversation with the Primary replica. The Secondary replica sends <xref href="system.fabric._operation_data" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> objects with which the Primary replica can determine the progress of collecting context on the Secondary replica. The Primary replica responds by sending the required state back. See <xref href="system.fabric._state_provider.getCopyState(SequenceNumber,OperationDataStream)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> at the Primary replica for the other half of the exchange. For in-memory services, the <xref href="system.fabric._state_provider.getCopyContext()" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> method is not called, as the state of the Secondary replicas is known (they are empty and will require all of the state). </p>
