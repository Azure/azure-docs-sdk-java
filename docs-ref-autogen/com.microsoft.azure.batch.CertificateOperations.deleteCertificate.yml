  summary: "Deletes the certificate from the Batch account.\n\nThe delete operation requests that the certificate be deleted. The request puts the certificate in the <xref uid=\"com.microsoft.azure.batch.protocol.models.CertificateState.DELETING\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"Deleting\"></xref> state. The Batch service will perform the actual certificate deletion without any further client action.\n\nYou cannot delete a certificate if a resource (pool or compute node) is using it. Before you can delete a certificate, you must therefore make sure that:\n\n *  The certificate is not associated with any pools.\n *  The certificate is not installed on any compute nodes. (Even if you remove a certificate from a pool, it is not removed from existing compute nodes in that pool until they restart.)\n\nIf you try to delete a certificate that is in use, the deletion fails. The certificate state changes to <xref uid=\"com.microsoft.azure.batch.protocol.models.CertificateState.DELETE_FAILED\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"Delete Failed\"></xref>.
