  summary: "Gets the unique number assigned to a message by Service Bus.\n\nThe sequence number is a unique 64-bit integer assigned to a message as it is accepted and stored by the broker and functions as its true identifier. For partitioned entities, the topmost 16 bits reflect the partition identifier. Sequence numbers monotonically increase and are gapless. They roll over to 0 when the 48-64 bit range is exhausted. This property is read-only."
