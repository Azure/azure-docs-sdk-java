    description: <p>A String representing the property of the health report. Together with the SourceId, it uniquely identifies the health information. </p>

    <p>Gets the property of the health report.</p>

    <p>

      <b>Remarks:</b>The property is a String and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter to categorize the health event for a specific property of the entity. For example, reporter A can report the health of the Node01 "storage" property and reporter B can report the health of the Node01 "connectivity" property. In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the Node01 entity. </p>
