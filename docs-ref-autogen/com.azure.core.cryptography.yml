desc: "<p>This package contains cryptography interfaces for Azure SDK client libraries. These interfaces allow client\n libraries to perform cryptographic operations using asymmetric and symmetric keys, such as encrypting, decrypting,\n signing, verifying, wrapping, and unwrapping keys. The package also provides classes that can resolve key\n encryption keys from a given key identifier.</p>\n\n <p>Some of the key concepts and features of the cryptography package are:</p>\n\n <ul>\n     <li><strong>Async Key Encryption Key and Key Encryption Key interfaces</strong>: These interfaces define the\n     methods for encrypting and decrypting keys, also known as key wrapping and unwrapping. They also support signing\n     and verifying data using the configured key.</li>\n\n     <li><strong>Async Key Encryption Key Resolver and Key Encryption Key Resolver interfaces</strong>: These\n     interfaces define the methods for resolving key encryption keys from a given key identifier. They can be used\n     to create instances of CryptographyClient.</li>\n </ul>"
