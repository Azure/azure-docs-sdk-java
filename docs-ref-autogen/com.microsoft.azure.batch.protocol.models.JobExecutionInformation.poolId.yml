  summary: "Get this element contains the actual Pool where the Job is assigned. When you get Job details from the service, they also contain a poolInfo element, which contains the Pool configuration data from when the Job was added or updated. That poolInfo element may also contain a poolId element. If it does, the two IDs are the same. If it does not, it means the Job ran on an auto Pool, and this property contains the ID of that auto Pool."
