  summary: "Set the primary purpose of the Job Release Task is to undo changes to Nodes made by the Job Preparation Task. Example activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services that were started as part of Job preparation. A Job Release Task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation Task for the Job. The Batch service runs the Job Release Task on the Compute Nodes that have run the Job Preparation Task."
