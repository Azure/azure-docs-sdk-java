    description: <p>Amount of time the primary replicator waits for receiving a quorum of acknowledgments for any pending replication operations when there is a request for the primary replicator to process a reconfiguration <xref uid="" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="java.time.Duration"></xref>. </p>
    type: <xref href="Duration?alt=Duration&text=Duration" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False"/>
  summary: >-
    <p>Defines how long the primary replicator waits for receiving a quorum of acknowledgments for any pending replication operations before processing a reconfiguration request, that could potentially result in ‘cancelling’ the pending replication operations.</p>

    <p>

      <b>Remarks:</b>The default value is 0. This implies that reconfigurations aren’t waited upon for receiving quorum on the pending replication operations. This helps in completing reconfigurations sooner. Note that larger values for this parameter could potentially result in slower reconfigurations, implying longer durations to fail-over a primary. </p>
