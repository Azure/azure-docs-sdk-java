  summary: "Sets the <xref uid=\"com.azure.core.http.HttpClient\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"HttpClient\"></xref> to use for sending and receiving requests to and from the service.\n\n**Note:** It is important to understand the precedence order of the HttpTrait APIs. In particular, if a <xref uid=\"com.azure.core.http.HttpPipeline\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"HttpPipeline\"></xref> is specified, this takes precedence over all other APIs in the trait, and they will be ignored. If no <xref uid=\"com.azure.core.http.HttpPipeline\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"HttpPipeline\"></xref> is specified, a HTTP pipeline will be constructed internally based on the settings provided to this trait. Additionally, there may be other APIs in types that implement this trait that are also ignored if an <xref uid=\"com.azure.core.http.HttpPipeline\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"HttpPipeline\"></xref> is specified, so please be sure to refer to the documentation of types that implement this trait to understand the full set of implications."
