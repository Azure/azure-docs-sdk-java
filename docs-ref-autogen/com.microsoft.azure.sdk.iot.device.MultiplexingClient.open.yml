Even when this is thrown, the AMQPS/AMQPS_WS connection is still open, and other clients may be registered to it. </p>
  summary: >-
    <p>Opens this multiplexing client. This may be done before or after registering any number of device clients. </p>

    <p>This call behaves synchronously, so if it returns without throwing, then all registered device clients were successfully opened. </p>

    <p>If this client is already open, then this method will do nothing. </p>
