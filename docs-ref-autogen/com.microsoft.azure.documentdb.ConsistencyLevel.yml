fields:
- fullName: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.BoundedStaleness
  name: BoundedStaleness
  nameWithType: ConsistencyLevel.BoundedStaleness
  summary: <p>Bounded Staleness guarantees that reads are not too out-of-date. This can be configured based on number of operations (MaxStalenessPrefix) or time (MaxStalenessIntervalInSeconds) </p>
  uid: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.BoundedStaleness
- fullName: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.ConsistentPrefix
  name: ConsistentPrefix
  nameWithType: ConsistencyLevel.ConsistentPrefix
  summary: <p>ConsistentPrefix Consistency guarantees that reads will return some prefix of all writes with no gaps. All writes will be eventually be available for reads. </p>
  uid: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.ConsistentPrefix
- fullName: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.Eventual
  name: Eventual
  nameWithType: ConsistencyLevel.Eventual
  summary: <p>Eventual Consistency guarantees that reads will return a subset of writes. All writes will be eventually be available for reads. </p>
  uid: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.Eventual
- fullName: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.Session
  name: Session
  nameWithType: ConsistencyLevel.Session
  summary: <p>Session Consistency guarantees monotonic reads (you never read old data, then new, then old again), monotonic writes (writes are ordered) and read your writes (your writes are immediately visible to your reads) within any single session. </p>
  uid: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.Session
- fullName: com.microsoft.azure.documentdb.ConsistencyLevel.Strong
  name: Strong
  nameWithType: ConsistencyLevel.Strong
  summary: <p>Strong Consistency guarantees that read operations always return the value that was last written. </p>
