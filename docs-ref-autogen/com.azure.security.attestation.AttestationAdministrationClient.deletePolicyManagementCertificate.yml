  summary: "Deletes a policy management certificate from the set of policy management certificates.\n\nEach Isolated mode attestation service instance maintains a set of certificates which can be used to authorize policy modification operations (in Isolated mode, each policy modification request needs to be signed with the private key associated with one of the policy management certificates).\n\nThis API allows the caller to remove an existing certificate from the set of policy management certificates.\n\nThe request to add a new certificate must be signed with one of the existing policy management certificates, so the <xref uid=\"com.azure.security.attestation.models.PolicyManagementCertificateOptions\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"PolicyManagementCertificateOptions\"></xref> object requires both the new certificate to be added and a <xref uid=\"com.azure.security.attestation.models.AttestationSigningKey\" data-throw-if-not-resolved=\"false\" data-raw-source=\"AttestationSigningKey\"></xref> to sign the add request.\n\n**Add a new certificate to the set of policy management certificates for this instance.**\n\n```java\nPolicyCertificatesModificationResult removeResult = client.deletePolicyManagementCertificate(\n     new PolicyManagementCertificateOptions(certificateToAdd, new AttestationSigningKey(certificate, privateKey)));\n System.out.printf(\" Result: %s\\n\", removeResult.getCertificateResolution().toString());\n```\n\n***Note:*** It is not considered an error to removethe same certificate twice. If the same certificate is removed twice, the service ignores the second remove request. This also means that it is not an error to remove a certificate which was not actually in the set of policy certificates."
