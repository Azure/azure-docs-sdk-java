# Azure Storage libraries for Java

The Azure Storage libraries for Java provide classes for working with data in your your Azure storage account, and with the storage account itself. For more information about Azure Storage, see [Introduction to Azure Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction).

## Client library for data access

The Azure Storage client library for Java supports Blob storage, Queue storage, Azure Files, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (preview library).

### Add the package to your project

Add the following dependencies to your Maven `pom.xml` file as appropriate:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-storage-blob</artifactId>
    <version>12.4.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-storage-queue</artifactId>
  <version>12.3.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-storage-file-share</artifactId>
  <version>12.2.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-storage-file-datalake</artifactId>
  <version>12.0.0-preview.6</version>
</dependency>
```

For more information about adding a dependency in Java, see [Add a dependency](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#How_do_I_use_external_dependencies).

### Example usage

The following example creates a storage container and uploads a local file to the storage container.

```java
String yourSasToken = "<insert-your-sas-token>";
/* Create a new BlobServiceClient with a SAS Token */
BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClientBuilder()
    .endpoint("https://your-storage-account-url.storage.windows.net")
    .sasToken(yourSasToken)
    .buildClient();

/* Create a new container client */
try {
    containerClient = blobServiceClient.createBlobContainer("my-container-name");
} catch (BlobStorageException ex) {
    // The container may already exist, so don't throw an error
    if (!ex.getErrorCode().equals(BlobErrorCode.CONTAINER_ALREADY_EXISTS)) {
        throw ex;
    }
}

/* Upload the file to the container */
BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.getBlobClient("my-remote-file.jpg");
blobClient.uploadFromFile("my-local-file.jpg");
```

For more examples, review the [Client Library README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/azure-storage-blob_12.0.0/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/README.md).

Refer to the [Azure SDK Releases page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/) for details on how to install and use the preview packages.

## Client library for resource management

Use the Azure Storage resource provider to manage storage accounts, account keys, access tiers, and more. To use the resource provider library, [add a dependency](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#How_do_I_use_external_dependencies) to your Maven `pom.xml` file. The latest version of the resource provider library is available on [Maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure.resourcemanager/azure-resourcemanager-storage).

For more information about the resource provider library, see the [Management](/java/api/overview/azure/resourcemanager-storage-readme) reference. The source code for the resource provider library is available in the [Azure Java SDK repository](https://aka.ms/azsdk/java/mgmt).

The following example creates a new storage account in your subscription and retrieves its access keys.

```java
StorageAccount storageAccount = azureResourceManager.storageAccounts().define(storageAccountName)
    .withRegion(Region.US_EAST)
    .withNewResourceGroup(rgName)
    .create();

// get a list of storage account keys related to the account
List<StorageAccountKey> storageAccountKeys = storageAccount.getKeys();
for (StorageAccountKey key : storageAccountKeys) {
    System.out.println("Key name: " + key.keyName() + " with value "+ key.value());
}
```

## Known issues

### 1. Buffer overwrite issue with `BlobOutputStream`

#### Issue description

If a `BlobOutputStream` object is used to upload blobs, in some scenarios this usage may result in an invalid object being written to Azure Blob Storage. `BlobOutputStream` object can be obtained via `BlockBlobClient.getBlobOutputStream()`.

Uploading a file larger than the value of `MaxSingleUploadSize` using the `write()` method of the `BlobOutputStream` class results in an invalid object being written to Azure Blob Storage. The default value of `MaxSingleUploadSize` is 256 MiB. You can change this value by calling the `setMaxSingleUploadSizeLong()` method of the `ParallelTransferOptions` class.

After the input data size crosses the `MaxSingleUploadSize`, the `write()` method of BlobOutputStream returns before making a deep copy of the input data. If the invoking application overwrites the input data byte array with other data before the deep copy takes place, invalid data may be written to the blob.

#### Issue details

| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Storage Blob | 12.0 to 12.10.0 | 12.10.1 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.22.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob) |

#### Recommended steps

1. Update client library versions according to the table above.
1. Check if your application code is calling `BlockBlobClient.getBlobOutputStream()`. If you find it, your application is impacted.

Additionally, you can identify any potentially affected blobs due to this issue in your Azure Storage account. Follow steps below to identify potentially affected blobs:

1. Check whether your application is using `BlobOutputStream` to upload blobs (obtained via `BlockBlobClient.getBlobOutputStream()`). If not, then this issue doesn't affect your application. However, we still recommend that you upgrade your application to use version 12.22.1 or later.
1. Get the `MaxSingleUploadSize` value for your application (256 MiB by default). Scan your code for `setMaxSingleUploadSizeLong()` method of the `ParallelTransferOptions` class and get value you provided for this property.
1. Identify the time window when your application used client library version with this issue (12.0 to 12.10.0)
1. Identify all the blobs uploaded in this time window. You can get a list of blobs by calling the `List Blobs` operation with PowerShell [PowerShell](/azure/storage/blobs/blob-powershell#list-blobs), [Azure CLI](/azure/storage/blobs/blob-cli#list-blobs), or another tool. You can also leverage the [blob inventory feature](/azure/storage/blobs/blob-inventory).

Following these steps will indicate blobs that are potentially impacted by the critical issue and may be invalid. Inspect these blobs to determine which ones may be invalid.

### 2. Invalid data uploaded during retries

#### Issue description

The client libraries listed below have a bug that can upload incorrect data during retries following a failed service request (for example, a retry caused by an HTTP 500 response).

#### Issue details

| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Storage Blob | 12.0 to 12.6.1 | 12.7.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.22.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob) |
| Azure File Data Lake | 12.0 to 12.1.2 | 12.2.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.8.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-file-datalake) |
| Azure File Share | 12.0 to 12.4.1 | 12.5.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.5.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-file-share) |

#### Recommended steps

1. Update client library versions according to the table above.

Note: Azure doesn't have the ability to recover incorrectly written objects. As any potential impact occurs before upload, Azure doesn't have a valid copy of any affected object. If you have the original file, it can be reuploaded to your storage account.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 3. Upload incorrectly returning as successful when `IOException` occurs

#### Issue description

All overloads of `void BlobClient.upload()` and `void BlobClient.uploadWithResponse()` silently catch error responses from the storage service. The method should either return or throw as its success/error indicator. The exception, which should have been logged and propagated would instead be directly written to standard error and then swallowed, despite throwing being the only failure indicator for the API. The method therefore successfully returns, making the caller think the operation completed. This results in the blob not having been written to storage, despite the library indicating success.

#### Issue details

| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Storage Blob | 12.0 to 12.4.0 | 12.5.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.22.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 4. Incorrect data being downloaded with `downloadToFile`

#### Issue description

Asynchronous buffer writing has a race condition where the buffer between the network stream and the file stream could be reused for incoming data before being flushed to file. This results in the downloaded file being corrupted, where some data immediately repeats, overwriting the valid data in its place. The object in Storage is still correct.

#### Issue details

| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Storage Blob | 12.0 to 12.2.0 | 12.3.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.22.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 5. Overwrite parameter not honored while uploading large file, resulting in incorrect overwrite

#### Issue description

The overwrite flag isn't being honored in cases where there's another parallel upload job in progress. This results in not overwriting an object in Storage when intended.

#### Issue details
| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Storage Blob | 12.0 | 12.1.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.22.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 6. Overwrite operation reversed for overwrite parameter, resulting in incorrect overwrite

#### Issue description

The overwrite parameter and overwrite operation are reversed in `DataLakeFileClient.flush(long)` and `DataLakeFileClient.flush(long, bool)` functions. No other behaviors of the library call into these methods. This results in overwriting an object in Storage when the user didn't intend to, and failing to overwrite when intended.

#### Issue details
| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure File Data Lake | 12.0 to 12.7.0 | 12.8.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.8.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-file-datalake) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 7. Message content incorrectly erased when only visibility timeout set

#### Issue description

Queue message contents are erased in error when only the visibility timeout was set or updated.

#### Issue details

| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Storage Queue | 12.0 to 12.6.0 | 12.7.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.7.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-queue) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 8. Client-side encryption updated to use AES-GCM due to security vulnerabilities in CBC mode

#### Issue description

To mitigate a security vulnerability found in CBC mode, the Java v12 SDK has released new version of client-side encryption called **v2**, which uses AES-GCM for client-side encryption instead of CBC mode. The updated SDKs are backward compatible and provide the ability for you to read and write data encrypted with the **v1** version. For complete details, please read [Azure Storage updating client-side encryption in SDK to address security vulnerability](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-storage-blog/ga-azure-storage-updating-client-side-encryption-in-sdk-to/ba-p/3563013). Section 2 of the blog post outlines steps to take to see if this issue affects you.

#### Issue details

| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Blob Storage Cryptography | 12.0 to 12.16.1 | 12.17.0 | [Update to latest version](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob-cryptography) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above. Please read [Azure Storage updating client-side encryption in SDK to address security vulnerability](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-storage-blog/ga-azure-storage-updating-client-side-encryption-in-sdk-to/ba-p/3563013) for recommended action.

### 9. Incorrect data being downloaded with downloadToFile() when underlying REST requests are retried

#### Issue description

The Azure SDK for Java Storage library had a bug where incorrect data could be written to a file with the `downloadToFile()` method when some of the underlying Storage REST requests experienced network failure midway through. This bug was originally introduced in the summer of 2022 and was [patched in May 2023](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/CHANGELOG.md#bugs-fixed-1) by returning to the previous behavior. The impacted versions are 12.19.0 through 12.22.0. The patch is in 12.22.1.

#### Issue details
| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Storage Blob | 12.19.0 to 12.22.0 | 12.22.1 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.22.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 10. InvalidHeaderValue error message when using beta version of SDK

In rare scenarios, applications that have upgraded to the latest beta or generally available version of the SDK can receive an `InvalidHeaderValue` error message. This issue can occur when using any of the Storage libraries. The error message looks similar to the following sample:

```console
HTTP/1.1 400 The value for one of the HTTP headers is not in the correct format.
Content-Length: 328
Content-Type: application/xml
Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
x-ms-request-id: <REMOVED>
Date: Fri, 19 May 2023 17:10:33 GMT
 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Error><Code>InvalidHeaderValue</Code><Message>The value for one of the HTTP headers is not in the correct format.
RequestId:<REMOVED>
Time:2023-05-19T17:10:34.2972651Z</Message><HeaderName>x-ms-version</HeaderName><HeaderValue>yyyy-mm-dd</HeaderValue></Error> 
```

If you've upgraded to the latest beta or generally available version of the SDK and you experience this error, it's recommended that you downgrade to the previous generally available version of the SDK to see if the issue resolves. If the issue persists, or if the recommendation is not feasible, [open a support ticket](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support) to explore further options.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 11. Uploading with `BlobClient.upload(InputStream data)` overwrites existing blob by default

#### Issue description

The `BlobClient.upload(InputStream data)` method overwrites an existing blob by default. This behavior contradicts the method description. To prevent overwriting an existing blob, you can use the `BlobClient.upload(InputStream data, boolean overwrite)` method and set the `overwrite` parameter to `false`.

#### Issue details

| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Storage Blob | 12.20.0-beta.1 to 12.29.0-beta.1 | 12.29.0 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.29.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above.

[Back to list of known issues](#list-of-known-issues)

### 12. Downloading with `ShareFileClient.downloadToFile()` can write incorrect data to a file

#### Issue description

In the **azure-storage-file-share** package, the `ShareFileClient.downloadToFile()` method can write incorrect data to a file when more than 5 retries occur due to partial network responses while streaming data. The maximum number of retries is unintentionally higher (up to a maximum of 15), which can result in writing to incorrect positions in the file when the operation is retried more than 5 times. This issue doesn't affect data in the Storage service, only data being written to the local file system.

#### Issue details

| Client library | Versions impacted | Minimum safe version | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure File Share | 12.15.0 to 12.25.0 | 12.25.1 | [Update to latest version or minimum 12.25.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-file-share) |

#### Recommended steps

Update client library versions according to the table above.
