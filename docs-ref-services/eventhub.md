# Azure Event Hub libraries for Java

## Overview

Collect and manage millions of events per second from connected IoT devices and applications with [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs).

To get started with Azure Event Hubs, see [Receive events from Azure Event Hubs using Java](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-java-get-started-receive-eph).


## Client library

Send events to an Azure Event Hub and consume and process events from an Event Hub using the Event Hubs client library.

[Add a dependency](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#How_do_I_use_external_dependencies) to your Maven `pom.xml` file to use the client library in your project.  

```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-eventhubs</artifactId>
    <version>0.14.3</version>
</dependency>
```   

## Example

Send an event to an event hub.

```java
ConnectionStringBuilder connStr = new ConnectionStringBuilder(namespaceName, eventHubName,sasKeyName, sasKey);

byte[] payloadBytes = "Test AMQP message from JMS".getBytes("UTF-8");
EventData sendEvent = new EventData(payloadBytes);
EventHubClient ehClient = EventHubClient.createFromConnectionStringSync(connStr.toString());
ehClient.sendSync(sendEvent);
```
