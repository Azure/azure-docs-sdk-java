# Azure Event Hub libraries for Java

## Overview

Collect and manage millions of events per second from connected IoT devices and applications with [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs).

To get started with Azure Event Hubs, see [Receive events from Azure Event Hubs using Java](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-java-get-started-receive-eph).


## Client library

Send events to an Azure Event Hub and consume and process events from an Event Hub using the Event Hubs client library.

[Add a dependency](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#How_do_I_use_external_dependencies) to your Maven `pom.xml` file to use the [client library](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure/azure-eventhubs) in your project.
 

## Example

Send an event to an event hub.

```java
final ConnectionStringBuilder connStr = new ConnectionStringBuilder()
                                            .setNamespaceName(namespaceName)
                                            .setEventHubName(eventHubName)
                                            .setSasKeyName(sasKeyName)
                                            .setSasKey(sasKey);
final EventHubClient ehClient = EventHubClient.createSync(connStr.toString());

final byte[] payloadBytes = "Test AMQP message".getBytes("UTF-8");
final EventData sendEvent = new EventData(payloadBytes);

ehClient.sendSync(sendEvent);
```
