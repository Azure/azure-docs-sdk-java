  summary: >-
    <p>Prevents the optimistic acknowledgment of operations in non-persistent services by requiring that the service calls <xref uid="system.fabric.Operation.acknowledge()" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">system.fabric.Operation#acknowledge()</xref> before it pumps the next operation.</p>

    <p>

      <b>Remarks:</b>Non-persistent services which require explicit acknowledgment can set this property to True in order to prevent optimistic acknowledgment of the operations by the Replicator. This setting has no effect for persistent services. The default value is false. </p>
