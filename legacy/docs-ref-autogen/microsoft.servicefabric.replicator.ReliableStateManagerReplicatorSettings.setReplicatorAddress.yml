    <p>Sets the address in {ip}:{port} format that this replicator will use when communicating with other replicators. The default value is "localhost:0", which picks a dynamic port number in runtime. If replicator is running inside a container, you should try setting up <xref uid="" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">ReliableStateManagerReplicatorSettings#replicatorListenAddress</xref> and <xref uid="" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">ReliableStateManagerReplicatorSettings#replicatorPublishAddress</xref>.</p>
