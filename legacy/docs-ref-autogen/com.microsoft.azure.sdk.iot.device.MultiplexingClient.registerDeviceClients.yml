A device client will not be unregistered automatically if it encounters a non-retryable exception, so users are responsible for unregistering a device client when they no longer want it in this multiplexing client. </p>

    <p>If the multiplexing client is already open, then these device clients will automatically be opened, too.

    <p>Any proxy settings set to the provided device clients will be overwritten by the proxy settings of this multiplexing client. </p>

    <p>The registered device clients must use the same transport protocol (AMQPS or AMQPS_WS) that this multiplexing client uses. </p>

    <p>Each registered device client may have its own retry policy and its own SAS token expiry time, separate from every other registered device client. </p>

    <p>The registered device clients must use symmetric key based authentication. </p>

    <p>The registered device clients must belong to the same IoT hub as all previously registered device clients. </p>

    <p>If any of these device clients are already registered to this multiplexing client, then then this method will not do anything to that particular device client. All other provided device clients will still be registered though. </p>

    <p>Any subscriptions (twin, methods, cloud to device messages) set on these device clients from when it was previously registered to any multiplexing client will need to be set again as subscriptions and their callbacks are not preserved. </p>
