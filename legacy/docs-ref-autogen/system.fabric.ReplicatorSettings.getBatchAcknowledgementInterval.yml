    description: <p>The amount of time that the replicator waits after receiving an operation before sending back an acknowledgment. </p>

  summary: >-
    <p>Gets the amount of time that the replicator waits after receiving an operation before sending back an acknowledgment.</p>

    <p>

      <b>Remarks:</b>Other operations received and acknowledged during this time period will have their acknowledgments sent back in a single message. Increasing the <xref uid="" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">system.fabric.ReplicatorSettings#batchAcknowledgementInterval</xref> value decreases latency of individual replication operations but increases throughput of the replicator. Default value is 0.05 Seconds (50 milliseconds) </p>
