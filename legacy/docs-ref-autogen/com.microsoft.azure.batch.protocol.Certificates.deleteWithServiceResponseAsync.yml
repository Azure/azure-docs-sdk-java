    <p>Deletes a certificate from the specified account. You cannot delete a certificate if a resource (pool or compute node) is using it. Before you can delete a certificate, you must therefore make sure that the certificate is not associated with any existing pools, the certificate is not installed on any compute nodes (even if you remove a certificate from a pool, it is not removed from existing compute nodes in that pool until they restart), and no running tasks depend on the certificate. If you try to delete a certificate that is in use, the deletion fails. The certificate status changes to deleteFailed. You can use Cancel Delete Certificate to set the status back to active if you decide that you want to continue using the certificate.</p>
