  summary: >-
    <p>Renew a lease currently held by this host instance. </p>

    <p>If the lease has been taken by another host instance (either stolen or after expiration) or explicitly released, renewLease must return false. With the Azure Storage-based implementation, it IS possible to renew an expired lease that has not been taken by another host, so your implementation can allow that or not, whichever is convenient. If it does not, renewLease should return false.</p>
