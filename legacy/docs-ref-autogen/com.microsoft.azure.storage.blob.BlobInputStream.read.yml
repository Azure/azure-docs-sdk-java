  summary: >-
    <p>Reads up to  bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as  bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.</p>

    <p>If  is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into .</p>

    <p>The first byte read is stored into element , the next one into , and so on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to . Let  be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements  through , leaving elements  through  unaffected.</p>

    <p>In every case, elements  through  and elements  through  are unaffected.</p>

    <p>The  method for class <xref uid="" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="InputStream"></xref> simply calls the method  repeatedly. If the first such call results in an , that exception is returned from the call to the  method. If any subsequent call to  results in a , the exception is caught and treated as if it were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into  and the number of bytes read before the exception occurred is returned. The default implementation of this method blocks until the requested amount of input data  has been read, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. Subclasses are encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.</p>
