  summary: >-
    <p>Sets a value to indicate whether https socket keep-alive should be disabled. Use  to disable keep-alive; otherwise, </p>

    <p>The default is set in the client and is by default false, indicating that https socket keep-alive will be enabled. You can change the value on this request by setting this property. You can also change the value on on the <xref uid="com.microsoft.azure.storage.ServiceClient.getDefaultRequestOptions()" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false">ServiceClient#getDefaultRequestOptions()</xref> object so that all subsequent requests made via the service client will use the appropriate value. </p>

    <p>Setting keep-alive on https sockets is to work around a bug in the JVM where connection timeouts are not honored on retried requests. In those cases, we use socket keep-alive as a fallback. Unfortunately, the timeout value must be taken from a JVM property rather than configured locally. Therefore, in rare cases the JVM has configured aggressively short keep-alive times, it may be beneficial to disable the use of keep-alives lest they interfere with long running data transfer operations.</p>
