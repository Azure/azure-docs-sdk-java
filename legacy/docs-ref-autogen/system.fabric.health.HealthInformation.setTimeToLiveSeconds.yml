      <b>Remarks:</b>When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live. If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite. When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired is false. </p>
