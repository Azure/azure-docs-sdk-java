    <p>Deletes the certificate from the Batch account. </p>

    <p>The delete operation requests that the certificate be deleted. The request puts the certificate in the <xref uid="com.microsoft.azure.batch.protocol.models.CertificateState.DELETING" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="Deleting"></xref> state. The Batch service will perform the actual certificate deletion without any further client action.</p>

    <p>You cannot delete a certificate if a resource (pool or compute node) is using it. Before you can delete a certificate, you must therefore make sure that:</p>

    <p>

      <ul>

        <li>

          <p>The certificate is not associated with any pools. </p>

        </li>

        <li>

          <p>The certificate is not installed on any compute nodes. (Even if you remove a certificate from a pool, it is not removed from existing compute nodes in that pool until they restart.) </p>

        </li>

      </ul>

    </p>

    <p>If you try to delete a certificate that is in use, the deletion fails. The certificate state changes to <xref uid="com.microsoft.azure.batch.protocol.models.CertificateState.DELETE_FAILED" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="Delete Failed"></xref>. You can use <xref uid="com.microsoft.azure.batch.CertificateOperations.cancelDeleteCertificate(String,String)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="cancelDeleteCertificate(String, String)"></xref> to set the status back to Active if you decide that you want to continue using the certificate.</p>
