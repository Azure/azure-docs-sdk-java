  summary: >-
    <p>Epoch is a concept used by Event Hub receivers. If a receiver is created on a partition with a higher epoch than the existing receiver, the previous receiver is forcibly disconnected. Attempting to create a receiver with a lower epoch than the existing receiver will fail. The Lease carries the epoch around so that when a host instance steals a lease, it can create a receiver with a higher epoch.</p>
