    <p>Acknowledges that this operation has been successfully applied at the Secondary replica. </p>

      <b>Remarks:</b>Services should call this method when they have obtained an <xref uid="" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="system.fabric.Operation"></xref> from the replicator and successfully applied it to their local store. For persisted services, calling this method is mandatory because the <xref uid="system.fabric.FabricReplicator" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="system.fabric.FabricReplicator"></xref> does not release additional objects that implement <xref uid="" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="system.fabric.Operation"></xref>. For volatile services, the replicator implicitly acknowledges operations when they are received unless they are configured otherwise by setting the value <xref uid="system.fabric.ReplicatorSettings.isRequireServiceAck()" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="system.fabric.ReplicatorSettings#isRequireServiceAck()"></xref> to true. An operation must be acknowledged by a quorum of replicas before the Primary replica receives the <xref uid="system.fabric.StateReplicator.replicateAsync(OperationData,SequenceNumber,CancellationToken)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false" data-raw-source="system.fabric.StateReplicator#replicateAsync(OperationData, SequenceNumber, system.fabric.CancellationToken)"></xref> operation complete responses. </p>
