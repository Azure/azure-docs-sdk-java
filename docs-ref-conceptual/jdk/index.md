# Java Long-Term Support for Azure and Azure Stack

Java developers on Azure and Azure Stack can build and run production Java applications using [Azul Zulu Enterprise for Azure](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) without incurring additional support costs. You can use any Java runtime you want on Azure, but when you use Zulu you get free maintenance updates and can create support issues with Microsoft.

## Long-term support (LTS)

* [Java 11](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#java11)
* [Java 8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#java8)
* [Java 7](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#java7)

## Technical preview

## What is the Zulu OpenJDK for Azure?

Azul Zulu Enterprise builds of OpenJDK are a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of the OpenJDK for Azure and Azure Stack backed by Microsoft and Azul Systems. These distributions are:

* 100% open source builds of OpenJDK packaged as Java Development Kits (JDKs), Java Runtime Environments (JREs), and Headless JREs. These binaries are fully compatible and compliant commercial builds of Java Standard Edition (SE) that can be used with Java applications or components on Azure and Azure Stack.
* Provided with long-term support including bug fixes, performance enhancements, and security patches.
* Available for developing and running Java applications on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
* Available as container images on Docker Hub and as virtual machines (Windows and Linux) on Azure Marketplace.
* Used by Microsoft Azure to power many Azure services, such as:
  * App Service Windows
  * App Service Linux
  * Functions
  * Service Fabric
  * HDInsight
  * Search
  * Azure DevOps
  * Cloud Shell  

## Supported Java versions and update schedule

Azul Systems provides fully-supported [Zulu Enterprise builds of OpenJDK for Microsoft Azure](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) for all long-term support (LTS) versions of Java, starting with Java SE 7, 8, and 11. More information can be found in the [Azul press release](https://www.azul.com/press_release/free-java-production-support-for-microsoft-azure-azure-stack).

|Java SE LTS  |Support until  |
|---------|----------|
|[![Java 7](../media/jdk/java-7.png)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#java7) |July 2023 |
|[![Java 8](../media/jdk/java-8.png)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#java8) |March 2025|
|[![Java 11](../media/jdk/java-11.png)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#java11) |Sept. 2026|

These JDK releases have quarterly security updates, bug fixes, and critical out-of-band updates and patches as needed.  This support includes back ports of security updates and bug fixes to Java 7 and 8 reported in newer versions of Java such as Java 11, which ensures the continued stability and security of older versions of Java.  Azure customers can get these security updates and platform bug fixes without incurring any unplanned Java SE subscription fees.

Azul Systems maintains a [Java SE roadmap](https://www.azul.com/products/azul_support_roadmap/) for these releases.

## Benefits for developers

The Azul Zulu JDK releases are:

1. Backed and supported by both Microsoft and Azul Systems

   * Zulu binaries are production-ready and backed by Microsoft and Azul Systems
   * Zulu comes with zero-cost long-term support (LTS) for Java 7, 8, and 11. (LTS will be provided for Java 17, as well). You can upgrade Java versions only when you need to.
   * Java 7 supported until July 2023. Java 8 and 11 are supported beyond 2024.
   * Microsoft is committed to running Zulu internally on machines that power many Azure services.

2. Production-ready

   * 100% open-source for its builds of OpenJDK.
   * Drop-in replacements for many Java SE distributions.
   * JDK, JRE, and JRE-headless
   * Java 7, 8, and 11
   * Verified compliant with the Java SE  specifications using the OpenJDK Community Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).
   * Developers will continue to receive production updates for Java SE, including bug fixes, performance enhancements, and security patches for Java SE 7, 8, and 11.

3. Supported for multi-platform. Zulu supports binaries for multiple platforms and versions, including:

   * Windows Client
     * 10
     * 8.1
     * 8, 7
   * Windows Server
     * 2016R2
     * 2016
     * 2012 R2
     * 2012
     * 2008 R2
   * Linux, including
     * RHEL
     * CentOS
     * Ubuntu
     * SLES
     * Debian
     * Oracle Linux
   * Mac OS X
   * delivered in multiple package types:
     * MSI, ZIP, TAR, DEB, RPM, and DMG

Certified Docker container images for Zulu JDK, JRE, and JRE-headless on multiple base OS images are available at Docker.

Hub:

* [JDK](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jdk)
* [JRE](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jre)
* [JRE-headless](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-java-jre-headless)

1. No cost

   * Microsoft provides everything you need to build and scale Java apps on Azure at no cost to you. Through Zulu you'll receive free security updates and platform bug fixes for Java apps without any fees.
   * [Java Flight Recorder and Mission Control](java-jdk-flight-recorder-and-mission-control.md) are available in Zulu Java 8, 11, and 12 (Preview).

1. Tech Preview of Non-LTS versions

   * Tech previews provide you with opportunities to progressively test new features as they are delivered in short-term versions that will eventually graduate to Java 17 LTS.

1. Changes to OpenJDK are up-streamed

   * Azul Systems committers push Zulu changes to OpenJDK which makes the upstream repo comprehensive and inclusive.

As always, Java developers can bring their own Java run-times, including Oracle JDK and Red Hat JDK, to Azure and use  the secure infrastructure and feature-rich services. The production edition of Oracle Java SE is also available to Java developers for running Java workloads in Windows or Linux virtual machines on Azure.

## Use for local development 

Developers can [download](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/) Java JDKs for Azure and Azure Stack for use in local development environments. Downloads are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Developers working on Linux can also get packages through the [yum](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#yum-repo) and [apt](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/#apt-repo) package managers.

For additional guidance see [Docker images for Azure](java-jdk-docker-images.md).
