## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this article, you will need to install the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse, which requires the following software components:

* An [Azure supported Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks)
* An [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* The [Azure Toolkit for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/azure-toolkit-eclipse), see [installation guide](../eclipse/azure-toolkit-for-eclipse-installation.md) for more information
* Be [signed in](../eclipse/azure-toolkit-for-eclipse-sign-in-instructions.md) to your Azure account for the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The [Azure Toolkit for Eclipse](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/azure-toolkit-eclipse) page at the Eclipse Marketplace lists the builds that are compatible with the toolkit.
> 

<!--
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> If you are using the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse on Windows, the toolkit requires installing the Azure SDK 2.9.6 or later in order to use the Azure emulator. You have two options for installing the Azure SDK:
> 
> * You can download and install the Azure SDK by using the [Web Platform Installer (WebPI)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252838).
> * If you do not have the Azure SDK installed when you create your first Azure deployment project, you will be prompted to automatically download install the requisite version of the Azure SDK.
> 
> Note that the Azure SDK is required on Windows only.
